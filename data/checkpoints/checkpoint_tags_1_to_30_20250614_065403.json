      "content": "BASINGSTOKE, United Kingdom, Feb.  24, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new study from Juniper Research, the foremost experts in fintech & payments markets, has found the number of Open Banking API calls globally will increase 427%, from 137 billion in 2025. The report predicts artificial intelligence (AI) will become increasingly integrated with open banking offerings; creating personalised banking solutions for users for finance management and customisable loan allowances, driving the growth of API call volume.\n\nAn extract from the new report, Global Open Banking APIs Market 2025-2029, is now available as a free download.\n\nAI Advancements Proliferating Open Banking\n\nJuniper Research found that API vendors are increasingly utilising AI for open banking offerings, with generative AI (GenAI) unlocking personalisation at scale. As API quality requirements have increased, across Europe in particular, personalising services through GenAI will prove to be a highly effective strategy for vendors.\n\nResearch Author Matthew Purnell remarked: “API quality is more than mitigating call failures but also enabling services. Personalised products are a necessity for Open Banking, with AI ideal for the automation of solutions for users. Consequently, vendors must invest in GenAI solutions to not only enhance banking offerings, but to streamline businesses’ workloads.”\n\nVendors to Enter Emerging Markets\n\nThe report found that 2024 was a significant year for open banking regulatory developments, with the Open Finance African Group Framework launching in key African markets, and Saudi Arabia proceeding with phase 2 of its Open Banking Framework. Accordingly, the research identified Middle East & Africa as a key developing market, with high-growth potential as digital banking improves and regulatory ecosystems develop.\n\nThe research recommends that API vendors must work with regional banks and businesses beyond the developed European-centric focus, to access markets in the early growth phases, establishing new revenue streams.\n\nAbout the Research\n\nThe new market research suite offers the most comprehensive assessment of the Open Banking APIs market to date, providing analysis and forecasts of over 23,000 datapoints across 61 countries over five years. It includes a ‘Competitor Leaderboard’ and examination of current and future market opportunities.\n\nJuniper Research has, for two decades, provided market intelligence and advisory services to the global financial sector, retained by many of the world’s leading banks, intermediaries, and providers.\n\nPlease contact Sam Smith, Press Relations\n\nT: +44(0)1256 830002\n\nE: sam.smith@juniperresearch.com",

A gene is a segment of DNA that carries hereditary information passed down through generations. All the genes collectively make up the genome, and they can contain information about physical traits, like height or eye color. Many genes provide instructions for producing RNA or protein molecules, which, though not visible, play crucial roles in the body’s cells. Cells are the basic building blocks of living organisms (including humans), acting as functional units that combine to form organs and tissues.\n\nGene therapy involves using genetic material to address genetic disorders. This can include adding a healthy version of a gene (gene addition) or correcting a mutated gene to its normal form (gene editing). The therapy can be administered either outside the body (ex vivo) or within the body (in vivo). Modified viruses or other delivery methods are used to introduce the gene into the cells' genome. Cell therapy, on the other hand, uses cells from the patient or a donor to treat diseases. Often, stem cells are used in cell therapy because they can develop into specialized cells.\n\nThese cells may or may not be genetically modified. In some cases, it's easier to remove cells from the body, treat them with gene therapy, and then reintroduce them, rather than applying the treatment directly within the body. This is common in treatments for blood disorders, where gene therapy and cell therapy are often combined.\n\nCell and Gene Therapies in Rare Disorders Epidemiology Segmentation\n\nThe cell and gene therapies in rare disorders epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current cell and gene therapies in rare disorders patient pool and forecasted trends for the 7MM. It helps recognize the causes of current and forecasted patient trends by exploring numerous studies and views of key opinion leaders.\n\nThe cell and gene therapies in rare disorders market report proffers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020–2034 in the 7MM segmented into:\n\nTotal Prevalent      Cases of Selected Indications for Cell and Gene Therapies in Rare      DisordersTotal      Indication-wise Eligible Cases for Cell and Gene Therapies in Rare      DisordersTotal      indication-wise Treated Cases for Cell and Gene Therapies in Rare      Disorders\n\nDownload the report to understand which factors are driving cell and gene therapies in rare disorders epidemiology trends @ Cell and Gene Therapies in Rare Disorders Epidemiological Insights\n\nCell and Gene Therapies in Rare Disorders Treatment Market\n\nCell and gene therapies facilitate the regeneration of diseased tissues by introducing healthy or engineered cells that can directly replace damaged tissue, support the recovery of existing healthy cells, or release factors that help repair affected cells. The approval of therapies such as LUXTURNA, HEMGENIX, ZYNTEGLO LIBMELDY, SKYSONA, HOLOCLAR, UPSTAZA, ROCTAVIAN, and others has established regulatory pathways for other cell and gene therapies currently in development.\n\nThe landscape of the cell and gene therapy market is expected to evolve as companies worldwide actively work on developing new treatment options for a diverse range of conditions, including hemophilia A and B, lysosomal storage disorders (such as Fabry, Pompe, Danon Disease, and various types of mucopolysaccharidoses), neurological disorders (like Batten disease and Parkinson’s), musculoskeletal conditions (including DMD, myotubular myopathy, and LGMD), and eye diseases (such as achromatopsia, choroideremia, limbal stem cell deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, retinoschisis, and age-related macular degeneration).\n\nAdditionally, research is advancing in areas like diabetic macular edema, metabolic disorders (e.g., Wilson’s disease, phenylketonuria, and urea cycle disorders), dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, gangliosidosis, and xerostomia. In recent years, the treatment landscape for rare disorders has transformed significantly due to advancements in cell and gene therapies.\n\nCompanies specializing in these therapies are now focusing on developing innovative solutions, particularly for rare genetic diseases. However, identifying the right candidates for cell and gene therapy requires thorough clinical evaluation, with long-term follow-up of study participants to ensure safety and efficacy. Overall, the future of cell and gene therapies appears highly promising.\n\nLearn more about the FDA-approved cell and gene therapies for rare disorders @ ApprovedCell and Gene Therapies in Rare Disorders Treatment\n\nEmerging Cell and Gene Therapies in Rare Disorders and Key Companies\n\nSome of the drugs in the pipeline include RGX-121 (REGENXBIO), isaralgagene civaparvovec (ST-920; Sangamo Therapeutics), CTx-PDE6b (HORA-PDE6b; Coave Therapeutics), GS030 (GenSight Biologics), DTX301 (Ultragenyx), and others.\n\nRGX-121 is an experimental, one-time gene therapy designed to introduce the iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) gene, which encodes the iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme, using the NAV AAV9 vector. The protein expressed by RGX-121 is structurally identical to natural I2S. This therapy is administered directly into the central nervous system (CNS) via intracisternal or intracerebroventricular delivery. By delivering the IDS gene to CNS cells, the therapy aims to establish a lasting source of secreted I2S beyond the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enabling sustained cross-correction of cells throughout the CNS.\n\nCurrently, in Phase III clinical trials for treating Hunter syndrome, RGX-121 has received multiple regulatory designations, including Orphan Drug Designation (ODD), Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, Fast Track Designation (FTD), and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) status from the U.S. FDA, as well as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) classification from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nIsaralgagene civaparvovec is a liver-targeting rAAV 2/6 vector that carries the cDNA for human α-Gal A and is administered via a single-dose intravenous infusion. Its goal is to introduce a functional copy of the GLA gene into liver cells, enabling them to produce functional α-Gal A. The company is currently conducting the Phase I/II STAAR clinical trial to evaluate its potential for treating Fabry disease.\n\nThe therapy has received Fast Track Designation (FTD), Orphan Drug Designation (ODD), and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) status from the US FDA, as well as PRIME eligibility and Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the EMA.\n\nIn October 2024, the company announced a successful regulatory interaction with the US FDA, outlining a clear path to Accelerated Approval for isaralgagene civaparvovec (ST-920). The company expects to generate data supporting this pathway in the first half of 2025, with a potential Biologics License Application (BLA) submission planned for the second half of 2025.\n\nCTx-PDE6b is an AAV5-based gene therapy aimed at delivering a full-length, non-mutated copy of the functional human PDE6b gene into the subretinal space. This approach enables rapid and robust transgene expression, leading to the production of functional PDE6b proteins in photoreceptive rods and cones. The company is currently conducting a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate its potential in treating Inherited retinal dystrophy. The therapy has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) by the US FDA.\n\nThe other cell and gene therapies in rare disorders include\n\nGiroctocogene      fitelparvovec: Pfizer/Sangamo TherapeuticsDirloctocogene      samoparvovec: Roche4D-310: 4D      Molecular TherapeuticsAT845: Astellas      Gene TherapieACTUS-101: Actus      TherapeuticsMCO-010      (sonpiretigene isteparvovec): Nanoscope TherapeuticsOCU400: OcugenjCell: jCyteAT-GTX-502      (scAAV9.P546.CLN3): Amicus TherapeuticsCAP-1002: Capricor      Therapeutics/Nippon ShinyakuNurOwn (MSC-NTF      cells): Brainstorm Cell TherapeuticsEDIT-301: Editas      MedicineEB-101: Abeona      TherapeuticsISN001: Ishin      PharmaUX111 (ABO-102):      Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, and others\n\nThe anticipated launch of these emerging cell and gene therapies are poised to transform the rare disorders market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the rare disorders market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth.\n\nTo know more about cell and gene therapies in rare disorders clinical trials, visit @ Emerging Cell and Gene Therapies in Rare Disorders\n\nCell and Gene Therapies in Rare Disorders Market Dynamics\n\nThe cell and gene therapies in rare disorders market dynamics are anticipated to change in the coming years. AAVs have emerged as the predominant vectors for delivering genes of interest to target tissues with improved specificity, efficiency, and safety, making them increasingly relevant for rare disease therapies. Companies in this space often benefit from niche markets, lower competition, and higher pricing power.\n\nTo encourage the development of treatments for rare diseases, including gene therapies, biopharmaceutical companies are incentivized by Orphan and Fast Track Designations, as well as longer market exclusivity. Gene therapies hold the potential for a paradigm shift in rare disease treatment, moving from symptomatic alleviation to disease modification and even cure.\n\nFurthermore, many potential cell and gene therapies are being investigated for the treatment of rare disorders, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact the market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate is expected to drive the growth of the cell and gene therapies in rare disorders market in the 7MM.\n\nHowever, several factors may impede the growth of the cell and gene therapies in rare disorders market. Despite advancements since the passage of the Orphan Drug Act, US patients with rare diseases still face significant barriers to diagnosis, care, and treatment. Even when therapies are available, the high out-of-pocket costs can be prohibitive. Orphan drugs are often priced higher than common treatments and generics to generate sufficient returns on investment, given small patient populations.\n\nAs more companies enter the gene therapy market, production capacity may become more competitive, potentially raising prices or limiting the utility of these treatments. Additionally, challenges like small patient groups, poorly understood disease processes, limited natural history data, and a lack of suitable outcomes hinder the development of effective cell and gene therapies.\n\nMoreover, rare disorders treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients’ overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, the cell and gene therapies in rare disorders market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies, unaffordable pricing, market access and reimbursement issues, and a shortage of healthcare specialists. In addition, the undiagnosed, unreported cases and the unawareness about the disease may also impact the cell and gene therapies in rare disorders market growth.\n\nReport MetricsDetailsStudy

      "content": "New York, USA, Feb.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evolving Landscape of Obesity: Key Market Insights of Latest Published Different Types of Obesity | DelveInsight\n\nThe obesity market size is projected to witness growth from 2024 to 2034 due to the rising prevalence of obesity. This expansion is expected to be further influenced by the extensive pipeline of emerging drugs, characterized by lower safety risks and improved profiles, throughout the study period.\n\nObesity is the second leading cause of preventable death and is linked to the development of inflammatory conditions that contribute directly and indirectly to various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, respiratory disorders, psychological challenges, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, cancer, and hyperlipidemia. It represents a major public health crisis that has steadily worsened over the past 50 years.\n\nThe prevalence of obesity has risen among both children and adults, affecting individuals of all genders in both developed and developing nations. In 2023, the total Prevalent population of Obesity in the United States was ~114 million cases, which as per DelveInsight’s estimates, is expected to increase by 2034.\n\nObesity management primarily focuses on reducing body weight and fat percentage to lower related health risks. Approaches include dietary changes, various forms of exercise, behavioral therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication, and surgical procedures such as intragastric balloons, bariatric surgery, and laparoscopic gastric banding.\n\nDespite the availability of approved obesity treatments, particularly pharmacotherapy, their usage remains limited due to factors like insurance coverage, cost, safety concerns, and doubts about effectiveness. FDA-approved medications include CONTRAVE (naltrexone-bupropion), SAXENDA (liraglutide), XENICAL (orlistat), QSYMIA (phentermine-topiramate), WEGOVY (semaglutide), and IMCIVREE (setmelanotide). Since obesity is not an immediate life-threatening condition, ensuring the safety of these drugs is a top priority.\n\nSeveral pharma companies such as Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Company, MedImmune, Boehringer Ingelheim, Raziel Therapeutics, Altimmune, Saniona, YSOPIA Bioscience, Innovent Biologics, Glaceum, Shionogi, Aardvark Therapeutics, NuSirt Biopharma, Novartis, CSPC Baike (Shandong) Biopharmaceutical, Jiangsu HengRui Medicine, Carmot Therapeutics, Pfizer, Sciwind Biosciences, Empros Pharma, and others are involved in developing drugs for obesity.\n\nThe expected launch of potential therapies in the market by key players during the forecast period (2024–2034), shall create a positive impact on the market size of Obesity in the 7MM. Moreover, the dynamics of the Obesity market are anticipated to change in the coming years owing to the development of disease-modifying treatment options.\n\nDiscover more about the obesity market in detail @ Obesity Market Report\n\nDelveInsight has expertise in the nutritional disorders market, and an experienced team handles the nutritional disorders domain proficiently. DelveInsight has recently released a series of epidemiology-based market reports on different types of obesity including Hypothalamic Obesity, Pediatric Obesity, HET Obesity/POMC Deficiency Obesity, Syndromic and Monogenic Obesity, and Pro-Opiomelanocortin (POMC) Deficiency Obesity & Leptin Receptor (LEPR) Deficiency Obesity. These reports include a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, emerging drugs, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted market size from 2020 to 2034  segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nAdditionally, the reports feature an examination of prominent companies working with their lead candidates in different stages of clinical development. Let’s deep dive into the market assessment of these obesity types individually.\n\nHypothalamic Obesity Market\n\nHypothalamic obesity is characterized by excessive weight gain resulting from damage to the hypothalamus, a crucial brain region responsible for various functions. The hypothalamus plays a key role in regulating both food intake and energy expenditure. When it is damaged, the balance between calorie consumption and burning is disrupted, often leading to increased food intake, reduced energy expenditure, and rapid weight gain.\n\nAccording to findings, in the United States, a variety of etiologies causing hypothalamic obesity were reported out of which 86% of patients reported having developed hypothalamic obesity as a result of a brain tumor or tumor treated by surgery, with or without associated cranial radiation.\n\nDiagnosis of hypothalamic obesity involves a physical examination, including anthropometric measurements and vital signs, as well as a review of medical history, previous weight management efforts, exercise habits, and family history. Laboratory tests may also be conducted to identify potential complications such as fatty liver disease and obesity-related diabetes.\n\nCurrently, there are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for hypothalamic obesity. Management primarily focuses on addressing the underlying condition and associated health issues while exploring various strategies to control obesity. However, the condition is often resistant to treatment. The approach includes optimizing pituitary hormone replacement, implementing dietary strategies (such as controlled carbohydrate intake and portion control), promoting physical activity, and incorporating mental and behavioral health interventions.\n\nIn some cases, weight-loss medications or metabolic/bariatric surgery may be considered. While surgical interventions tend to have the most significant impact, other treatments generally offer only modest benefits, which may not be effective for all patients. Certain medications, including stimulants, metformin, and GLP1R agonists, have shown potential benefits for some individuals.\n\nCompanies like LG Chem and Rhythm Pharmaceuticals are actively developing and testing new treatment candidates at various clinical stages, aiming to provide effective therapeutic options for hypothalamic obesity.\n\nFor a comprehensive view of the hypothalamic obesity market, check out the Hypothalamic Obesity Market Assessment\n\nPediatric Obesity Market\n\nPediatric obesity is typically determined using body mass index (BMI), which measures weight relative to squared height. In the US, the CDC classifies pediatric obesity as having a BMI at or above the 95th percentile, while severe obesity is defined as exceeding 120% of the 95th percentile or surpassing 35 kg/m², based on age- and sex-specific growth charts. This condition represents a major public health issue, necessitating a comprehensive strategy for prevention and treatment.\n\nIn 2023, there were approximately 8 million prevalent cases of obesity among children aged 5 to 19 in the 7MM. Given current lifestyle trends, this number is expected to increase at a significant rate. Early detection and intervention are essential to mitigating the long-term health risks associated with childhood obesity.\n\nObesity and related non-communicable diseases can largely be prevented and managed. Individuals can lower their risk by adopting preventive measures throughout different life stages, starting from pre-conception and continuing through early childhood. Treatment for pediatric obesity involves a multifaceted approach, including lifestyle modifications, medications, and, in some cases, weight-loss surgery.\n\nFor adolescents aged 12 and older, the FDA has approved medications such as XENICAL, SAXENDA, and WEGOVY to support weight management when combined with lifestyle changes, helping to achieve significant weight loss. Early intervention remains key to reducing long-term complications and enhancing overall health outcomes.\n\nPharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly and others, are actively developing treatments for pediatric obesity, with various candidates in different phases of clinical trials. However, the current pipeline of emerging therapies remains insufficient to address the increasing demand, highlighting the urgent need for more advanced and effective treatment options for children with obesity.\n\nDiscover more about pediatric obesity drugs in development @ Pediatric Obesity Clinical Trials\n\nProopiomelanocortin (POMC) Deficiency Obesity Market\n\nPOMC deficiency obesity is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, resulting in severe early-onset obesity. Affected individuals typically experience rapid weight gain during infancy and significant obesity from a young age. Approximately 100-500 people are living with POMC deficiency in the United States.\n\nCurrently, treatment options are limited and primarily focus on symptom management through dietary and lifestyle modifications. The only approved therapy for POMC deficiency-related obesity is IMCIVREE (setmelanotide), developed by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals.\n\nMelanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists are being explored as potential treatments, aiming to restore the disrupted melanocortin pathway. These therapies have shown promise in reducing appetite and supporting weight loss, with some advancing in clinical trials. However, the pipeline for POMC deficiency obesity remains underdeveloped, with few key players involved. The most notable drug currently in development is LB54640 (LR19021) by LG Chem/Rhythm Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDespite the limited pipeline, the market for POMC deficiency obesity is projected to grow, driven by advancements in targeted therapies such as MC4R agonists like setmelanotide. Greater awareness and improved genetic testing are expected to lead to earlier and more frequent diagnoses, thereby increasing the patient population.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the POMC obesity market, be sure to explore the Proopiomelanocortin Deficiency Obesity Market Outlook\n\nSyndromic and Monogenic Obesity Market\n\nSyndromic and monogenic obesity represent rare, genetically driven forms of the condition, distinct from polygenic or lifestyle-related obesity. Monogenic obesity results from single-gene mutations, typically affecting pathways related to appetite regulation, energy expenditure, and fat storage. Syndromic obesity, on the other hand, is associated with additional clinical manifestations such as developmental delays, dysmorphic features, and endocrine abnormalities.\n\nThe prevalence of monogenic obesity is estimated to be around 2–5% of severe early-onset obesity cases, whereas syndromic obesity is even rarer. Due to its genetic underpinnings, these forms of obesity often remain resistant to conventional weight management strategies like diet, exercise, and general anti-obesity medications. Currently, treatment options are limited, with lifestyle interventions proving largely ineffective. Bariatric surgery may be considered in severe cases, but its applicability is constrained in pediatric populations.

      "title": "CAPLYTA’s Strong Market Adoption Propels Its Rise as a Leading Antipsychotic Therapy | DelveInsight",
      "content": "New York, USA, Feb.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CAPLYTA’s Strong Market Adoption Propels Its Rise as a Leading Antipsychotic Therapy | DelveInsight\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies’ CAPLYTA is making waves in the antipsychotic market, gaining traction as a novel treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. With its differentiated safety profile and broad efficacy, it’s rapidly expanding its market share.\n\nDelveInsight’s “CAPLYTA Market Size, Forecast, and Market Insight Report” highlights the details around lumateperone, which is a novel dopamine D3-preferring D3/D2 receptor partial agonist and a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist medication indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. The report provides product descriptions, patent details, and competitor products (marketed and emerging therapies) of CAPLYTA. The report also highlights the historical and forecasted sales from 2020 to 2034 segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies’ CAPLYTA (lumateperone) Overview\n\nCAPLYTA (lumateperone), developed by Intra-Cellular Therapies, is an atypical antipsychotic approved in the U.S. for treating schizophrenia in adults and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression). It can be administered as a standalone treatment or in combination with lithium or valproate for bipolar depression.\n\nTaken orally, CAPLYTA’s exact mechanism of action in schizophrenia and bipolar depression is not fully understood. However, its effectiveness is thought to result from a combination of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor antagonism.\n\nCAPLYTA generated net product sales of $175.2 million in Q3 2024, reflecting an increase from $125.8 million in the same quarter of 2023. Total prescriptions for CAPLYTA grew by 38% year-over-year in Q3 2024 and rose by 9% compared to Q2 2024.\n\nCAPLYTA’s efficacy in schizophrenia was evaluated in two placebo-controlled trials. Study 1 (NCT01499563) was a four-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial involving adults diagnosed with schizophrenia under DSM-IV-TR criteria, measuring changes in the PANSS total score at Week 4. Study 2 (NCT02282761) followed a similar design but included patients diagnosed using DSM-5 criteria, with the PANSS total score at Week 4 as the primary efficacy endpoint.\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies is currently evaluating lumateperone for major depressive disorder as adjunctive therapy, pediatric indications, and a long-acting injectable program for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\n\nDrug NameCAPLYTA (lumateperone)Approved yearUS: 2019Molecule typeSmall moleculeDeveloperJohnson and Johnson (Intra-Cellular Therapies)IndicationSchizophrenia; bipolar I or II disorderRoute of administrationOralMechanism of actionDopamine D2 receptor modulators; Glutamate modulators; Serotonin   5-HT2A receptor antagonists; Serotonin uptake inhibitors\n\nLearn more about CAPLYTA projected market size for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder @ CAPLYTA Market Potential\n\nSchizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects cognition, emotions, decision-making, and social interactions. It typically emerges in late adolescence to early adulthood in men and later, in the late 20s to early 30s, in women. According to DelveInsight’s analysis, there were 3.8 million diagnosed prevalent cases of schizophrenia across the 7MM in 2023, with the US accounting for nearly 1.4 million cases.\n\nTreatment primarily relies on antipsychotic medications that target dopamine neurotransmitters. Second-generation antipsychotics are preferred due to their lower risk of severe side effects. Long-acting injectable formulations can enhance adherence and improve treatment outcomes. For patients with severe or treatment-resistant schizophrenia, high-dose medication regimens may be beneficial. In cases where medication is ineffective or during acute episodes, hospitalization and electroconvulsive therapy may be necessary.\n\nSeveral promising therapies are expected to enter the market during the forecast period. As a result of this, the schizophrenia market size in the 7MM will surge from USD 7.9 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow further by 2034.  Additionally, rising awareness and an increasing prevalence of schizophrenia are likely to drive market expansion in the coming years.\n\nDiscover more about the schizophrenia market in detail @ Schizophrenia Market Report\n\nEmerging Competitors of CAPLYTA\n\nThe schizophrenia market is very crowded and as a result, CAPLYTA will be getting fierce competition from several drugs. In September 2024, the FDA approved Bristol Myers Squibb's COBENFY (xanomeline and trospium chloride) formerly KarXT for treating schizophrenia in adults. COBENFY is the first new schizophrenia medication in decades, uniquely targeting M1 and M4 receptors in the brain without blocking D2 receptors.\n\nAmong the emerging therapies, CAPLYTA will get competition from Boehringer Ingelheim’s Iclepertin (BI-425809). Iclepertin is an experimental drug designed to inhibit glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) and target brain mechanisms associated with cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (CIAS). Dysfunction in glutamatergic signaling, specifically downstream of neuronal NMDA receptors, plays a role in cognitive deficits in this condition. Enhancing NMDA receptor activity may support synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.\n\nGlycine, a crucial co-agonist for NMDA receptors, is regulated by GlyT-1 and GlyT-2 transporters found in presynaptic and astrocyte membranes. These transporters control glycine levels by facilitating its uptake into nerve terminals and surrounding glial cells, thereby influencing synaptic glycine availability. By inhibiting GlyT-1, BI 425809 aims to elevate glycine levels and enhance NMDA receptor function.\n\nAdministered orally, this selective and potent GlyT1 inhibitor has also been studied for Alzheimer’s disease. However, Phase II trial results in early 2020 did not support further development for that condition. Research efforts are now focused on schizophrenia, with multiple Phase III trials in progress.\n\nSince schizophrenia patients often overlook cognitive symptoms, there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for CIAS. If approved, BI 425809 would become the first treatment specifically targeting cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.\n\nVarious potential therapies that are projected to enter the schizophrenia market and give tough competition to CAPLYTA include Teva Pharmaceutical/MedinCell/Royalty Pharma’s Olanzapine LAI (TEV-‘749), Sunovion Pharmaceutical (Sumitomo Pharma)/Otsuka’s Ulotaront (SEP-363856), Reviva Pharmaceuticals’ Brilaroxazine (RP5063), Minerva Neurosciences/Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma’s Roluperidone (MIN-101/MT-210), Rovi Pharmaceuticals Laboratories’ (Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi) OKEDI/RISVAN (risperidone ISM), Neurocrine Biosciences/Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma’s Valbenazine (NBI-98854), Lyndra Therapeutics’ LYN-005 (long-acting oral risperidone), and Newron Pharmaceuticals’ Evenamide (NW-3509), among others.\n\nTo know more about the number of competing drugs in development, visit @ CAPLYTA Market Positioning Compared to Other Drugs\n\nKey Milestones of CAPLYTA\n\nIn January 2025, Intra-Cellular      Therapies and Johnson & Johnson reached a definitive agreement,      under which Johnson & Johnson would acquire all outstanding shares of      Intra-Cellular Therapies for USD 132.00 per share, totaling an      equity value of around USD 14.6 billion.In January 2025, Intra-Cellular      Therapies settled patent litigation with Sandoz over CAPLYTA, allowing      Sandoz to sell a generic version starting in July 2040, or earlier under      certain conditions. The settlement will be submitted to the US Federal      Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice. Similar patent disputes      are still pending in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey.In December 2024, Intra-Cellular      Therapies announced its presentations at the 63rd Annual Meeting of      the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP), showcasing new      analyses on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability from its pivotal      CAPLYTA adjunctive treatment program for MDD.In December 2024, Intra-Cellular      Therapies submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the      US FDA for CAPLYTA, seeking approval for its use as adjunctive therapy to      antidepressants in the treatment of MDD in adults.In December 2021, the US FDA      approved CAPLYTA for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with      bipolar I or II disorder in adults, both as monotherapy and as an      adjunctive treatment with lithium or valproate.In December 2019, the US FDA      approved CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.\n\nDiscover how CAPLYTA is shaping the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder treatment landscape @ CAPLYTA Schizophrenia\n\nCAPLYTA Patent Details\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies own or control approximately 39 patent families for lumateperone, covering various salt forms, polymorphs, formulations, and new indications. As of February 2024, it holds 56 issued US patents and 240 foreign patents, with protection extending through 2043 for certain indications.\n\nCAPLYTA Market Dynamics\n\nCAPLYTA's excellent safety profile and effectiveness make it a preferred choice for patients with mood disorders, especially those experiencing side effects from other treatments. Ongoing clinical trials for its use as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder could significantly expand its total addressable market and annual sales forecasts.\n\nThe rising prevalence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, along with the demand for better-tolerated treatments, supports its market growth. Increased insurance coverage and favorable reimbursement policies could enhance patient access and drive sales, while growing awareness among psychiatrists and general practitioners may expand its adoption beyond the initial prescriber base. Additionally, as a newer entrant with a differentiated mechanism of action compared to some legacy medications, CAPLYTA is well-positioned for continued uptake.\n\nHowever, the company remains highly reliant on CAPLYTA, making it vulnerable to market fluctuations and competitive pressures, while the expiration of patent protections could lead to the introduction of generic versions that may significantly impact sales and market share. Additionally, the high cost of branded psychiatric medications could limit adoption, particularly in markets with stringent cost-containment measures. Uncertainty in the approval process for new indications, such as adjunctive MDD treatment, may further delay market expansion.\n\nAlthough CAPLYTA has a strong tolerability profile, emerging safety concerns or long-term side effects could hinder prescribing trends. Furthermore, competition from existing atypical antipsychotics and new pipeline therapies with potentially superior efficacy or safety, along with limited awareness among healthcare providers and patients regarding CAPLYTA’s benefits and differentiators, may further challenge its adoption and market position.\n\nDive deeper to get more insight into CAPLYTA’s strengths & weaknesses relative to competitors @ CAPLYTA Market Drug Report\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1Report Introduction2CAPLYTA (lumateperone): Johnson and Johnson (Intra-Cellular   Therapies)2.1Product Overview2.2Other Development Activities2.3Clinical Development2.4Clinical Trials Information2.5Safety and Efficacy2.6Product Profile2.7Market Assessment2.7.1The 7MM Analysis2.7.1.1Cost Assumptions and Rebate2.7.1.2Pricing Trends2.7.1.3Analogue Assessment2.7.1.4Launch Year and Therapy Uptake2.7.2The United States Market Analysis2.7.3EU4 and the United Kingdom Market Analysis2.7.3.1Germany2.7.3.2France2.7.3.3Italy2.7.3.4Spain2.7.3.5UK2.7.4Japan Market Analysis2.8Market Drivers2.9Market Barriers2.10SWOT Analysis3Key Cross of Marketed Competitors of CAPLYTA4Key Cross of Emerging Competitors of CAPLYTA\n\nRelated Reports\n\nSchizophrenia Market\n\nSchizophrenia Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast – 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key schizophrenia companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Sumitomo Pharma, Otsuka, Reviva Pharmaceuticals, Minerva Neurosciences, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Karuna Therapeutics, Royalty Pharma, ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical, MedinCell, Neurocrine Biosciences, Lyndra Therapeutics, Newron Pharmaceuticals, Luye Pharma, among others.\n\nSchizophrenia Pipeline\n\nSchizophrenia Pipeline Insight – 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key schizophrenia companies, including Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc., Gedeon Richter Ltd., Lyndra Therapeutics, Neurocrine Bioscience, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Memory Pharmaceuticals, Hoffmann-La Roche, Neurocrine Biosciences, Boehringer Ingelheim, Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd., SK Life Science, Inc., Alkermes, Inc. , Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, SyneuRx International (Taiwan) Corp, BioXcel Therapeutics Inc, Cognitive Research Corporation, Amarex Clinical Research, Forum Pharmaceuticals Inc, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Recognify Life Sciences, Accutest Research Laboratories (I) Pvt.

The in vivo approach is inherently less invasive than ex vivo methods, which often require complex surgical procedures to manipulate cells outside the body. As the demand for targeted therapies continues to rise, in vivo gene therapy has gained significant popularity, thereby driving the expansion of this segment within the market.\n\nThe ex vivo segment of the U.S. gene therapy market is projected to expand rapidly in the market in the coming years due to a number of factors. Ex vivo gene therapy deals with the modification of patient cells outside the host body and then reintroducing them after specific genetic changes. These type of therapeutics offer long-lasting effects. Ex vivo treatment is particularly used for treating genetic disorders where a one-time intervention can significantly improve patient quality of life. Advancements in gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 have caused a surge in ex vivo therapies.\n\nRoute of Administration Insights\n\nLeading the charge in the U.S. gene therapy market, the intravenous (IV) segment has garnered attention due to its unique advantages over other routes of administration. Intravenous delivery allows for quicker absorption and immediate therapeutic effects since the therapeutic agents go directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. This method is particularly advantageous as it facilitates the simultaneous treatment of multiple targeted organs, offering a comprehensive approach to patient care.\n\nThe rapid delivery of gene therapy to targeted tissues, combined with its remarkable effectiveness, has been crucial in bolstering this segment. Innovations in vector design and advanced delivery mechanisms have led to the evolution of minimally invasive intravenous therapies, further contributing to the growth and appeal of this route of administration in the gene therapy landscape.\n\nRelated Reports:\n\n• Cell and Gene Therapy Market:\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/cell-and-gene-therapy-market\n\n• U.S. Cell And Gene Therapy CDMO Market:\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/us-cell-and-gene-therapy-cdmo-market\n\n• U.S. Cell and Gene Therapy Bioanalytical Testing Services Market:\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/us-cell-and-gene-therapy-bioanalytical-testing-services-market\n\n• Cell Therapy Growth Factor Market:\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/cell-therapy-growth-factor-market\n\n• Cell Therapy Manufacturing Market:\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/cell-therapy-manufacturing-market\n\n• Compression Therapy Market\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/compression-therapy-market\n\n• U.S. CRISPR and Cas Genes Market\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/us-crispr-and-cas-genes-market\n\n• U.S. Gene Expression Market\r\nhttps://www.statifacts.com/outlook/us-gene-expression-market\n\nU.S. Gene Therapy Market Top Key Companies:\n\n• Amgen Inc.\n\n• Novartis AG\n\n• F.

      "title": "Hyperlipidemia Drugs Market Size to Promote USD 31.49 Bn by 2034",
      "content": "Ottawa, Feb.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global hyperlipidemia drugs market size was valued at USD 23.8 billion in 2024 and is predicted to hit around USD 30.62 billion by 2033, a study published by Towards Healthcare a sister firm of Precedence Statistics.\n\nGet All the Details in Our Solutions – Download Brochure: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/download-brochure/5418\n\nMarket Overview and Key Statistics\n\nThe word \"hyperlipidemia\" refers to a group of inherited and acquired conditions that are characterized by high amounts of lipids in the body. It is a relatively prevalent illness worldwide, but particularly in the Western Hemisphere. There are already over three million persons in the U.S. and Europe who have been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, and the number is rapidly increasing. Patients with premature coronary artery disease (CAD), which is defined as CAD that develops in males before the age of 55 to 60 and in females before the age of 65, have the greatest degree of hyperlipidemia. The incidence of hyperlipidemia is around 75–85% under the previously mentioned conditions, compared to approximately 40–48% in the control group of the same age but without early coronary artery disease.\n\nDriving Factors for Market Growth\n\nRising awareness\n\nAnother major factor propelling the expansion of the hyperlipidemia medication market is the growing awareness of hyperlipidemia. Although hyperlipidemia was formerly frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, knowledge of the illness and its dangers is gradually rising. Healthcare organizations' teaching programs and public health campaigns are partly to blame for this. The need for medications to treat hyperlipidemia is rising as more individuals become aware of the problem.\n\nDevelopment of better drugs\n\nAnother major factor propelling the expansion of the hyperlipidemia medication market is the creation of novel, more potent medications. Many novel medications for the treatment of hyperlipidemia have been licensed in recent years. These medications have fewer adverse effects and are more effective than previous ones. This is increasing their appeal to doctors and patients and propelling the market's expansion.\n\nRising cardiovascular diseases\n\nOne major driver propelling the market is the increasing incidence of cardiovascular illnesses. For example, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the top cause of death in the United States, accounting for around 6,10,000 fatalities yearly (about 1 in 4 deaths), according to research released by the National Library of Medicine in January 2024. Additionally, it is linked to 17.8 million fatalities each year and is the third most common cause of death globally. This emphasizes how important it is to have efficient medications for hyperlipidemia in order to control lipid levels and lower the risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nYou can place an order or ask any questions, please feel free to contact us at sales@towardshealthcare.com\n\nOpportunities in the Hyperlipidemia Drugs Market\n\nIn December 2024, as it increases production of its popular diabetes and weight-loss medications, Eli Lilly & Co. is investing an additional $3 billion to expand its manufacturing presence in the United States. Construction is anticipated to start next year on the most recent investment, which is the largest outside of the company's home state of Indiana. It will expand a recently acquired production factory in Wisconsin.In June 2024, launched with $190 million in combined Series A and B financings, Marea Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology firm that Third Rock Ventures is incubating to create a new generation of medications for cardiometabolic illnesses.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nRising cases of obesity are driving North America.\n\nNorth America held the largest share of the hyperlipidemia drugs market in 2024. Because of the rising incidence of hypercholesteremia, rising healthcare costs, and an established healthcare system, North America is anticipated to have a significant market position in the worldwide market for hyperlipidemia drugs. Furthermore, the rise in obesity in this area, which has led to the use of medications for hyperlipidemia diagnosis, is also expected to support market expansion. Problems with overweight and obesity impact one in five kids and teenagers. According to the research, over 14.7 million children and adolescents were afflicted by the 19.7% prevalence of obesity.\n\nAdditionally, it is anticipated that rising healthcare costs in the U.S. would fuel hyperlipidemia drugs market demand in this area. The United States Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services National Health Expenditure Data 2020 states that healthcare spending increased from 9.7% to USD 4.1 trillion in 2020, or approximately 19.7% of GDP. By 2028, it is anticipated that the spending would have reached USD 6.2 trillion. Over the course of the study's projected period, the increase in healthcare spending in the US area is probably going to spur market expansion.\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the biggest cause of mortality in the United States, accounting for about 7.2 million fatalities per year and a significant contributor to disability despite advancements in medical technology. The anticipated yearly direct and indirect expenses of stroke and CVD were over $310 billion in 2011–2012, and they are expected to nearly triple from 2010–2030, from $273 billion to $818 billion.\n\nGet the latest insights on healthcare industry segmentation with our Annual Membership: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/get-an-annual-membership\n\nThe presence of a strong pharma industry is driving the Asia Pacific.\n\nAsia Pacific is expected to host the fastest-growing hyperlipidemia drugs market during the forecast period. The market is driven by increased disposable income, sedentary lifestyles, and the growing prevalence of hyperlipidemia. The Korean Society of Lipids and Atherosclerosis reports that hyperlipidemia affects two out of every five Korean individuals. Between 2010 and 2030, China's cardiovascular incidents are predicted to rise by 9.2 million. The Asia-Pacific market is expanding thanks to a rise in clinical trials and research & development efforts. The development of generic medications for hyperlipidemia is accelerated by the rising demand for generic substitutes. India is the biggest manufacturer and supplier of generic medications worldwide. India exports over 40% of its generic medications worldwide. Foreign businesses are able to establish their manufacturing plants in Asia-Pacific nations due to the availability of adequate manufacturing infrastructure.\n\nMarket Segmentation\n\nBy drug class, the statins segment dominated the hyperlipidemia drugs market in 2024. People with elevated cholesterol are frequently prescribed statins by medical practitioners. Statins decrease total cholesterol and lessen the risk of stroke or heart attack. Statins come in a variety of forms. Even though they all serve the same purpose, doctors can advise experimenting with a few different alternatives to see which suits a patient the best.\n\nBy drug class, the PCSK9 inhibitors segment is estimated to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period. For those who are currently approved by the FDA, using PCSK9 inhibitors would result in a lifetime net worth of $5800 per person and an estimated 1.1-year increase in life expectancy at age 51. The lifetime net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors would be $14,100 per person if they were used in those who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nBy route of administration, the oral segment dominated the hyperlipidemia drugs market in 2024. Because of its numerous benefits, the oral administration route is chosen above the other drug delivery administration methods. These benefits include pain avoidance, simplicity of intake, safety, high patient compliance, and adaptability to different medication kinds.\n\nBy route of administration, the parenteral segment is expected to be the fastest-growing during the forecast period. Because parenterally administered drugs are absorbed more quickly than when taken orally, their effects start sooner. Because they are processed differently and do not pass through the gastrointestinal tract's digestive processes, they have a greater effect than oral medications.\n\nBy distribution channel, the retail pharmacies segment held the largest share of the hyperlipidemia drugs market in 2024. By interacting with the neighborhood to promote care journeys, prescription adherence, and value-based outcomes, retail pharmacists may broaden their role in healthcare.\n\nBy distribution channel, the online pharmacies segment I anticipated to grow rapidly during the forecast period. Increased accessibility to medications for persons who are confined to their homes or who reside far from a drugstore. The simplicity of comparing several websites to locate the finest deals and goods. Increased accessibility to a large range of items and convenience.\n\nlevate your healthcare strategy with Towards Healthcare.

      "title": "Existing-Home Sales Decreased 4.9% in January, But Increased Year-Over-Year for Fourth Consecutive Month",
      "content": "Washington, D.C., Feb.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nKey Highlights\n\nExisting-home sales slid 4.9% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.08 million. However, sales rose 2.0% from one year ago, the fourth straight monthly year-over-year increase.\n\nThe median existing-home sales price advanced 4.8% from January 2024 to $396,900, the 19th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases.The inventory of unsold existing homes grew 3.5% from the prior month to 1.18 million at the end of January, or the equivalent of 3.5 months’ supply at the current monthly sales pace.\n\nExisting-home sales retreated in January, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Sales slipped in three major U.S. regions and held steady in the Midwest. Year-over-year, sales rose in three regions and were unchanged in the South.\r\nTotal existing-home sales[1] – completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops – descended 4.9% from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.08 million in January. Year-over-year, sales improved 2.0% (up from 4 million in January 2024).\r\n“Mortgage rates have refused to budge for several months despite multiple rounds of short-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “When combined with elevated home prices, housing affordability remains a major challenge.”\r\nTotal housing inventory[2] registered at the end of January was 1.18 million units, up 3.5% from December and 16.8% from one year ago (1.01 million). Unsold inventory sits at a 3.5-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 3.2 months in December and 3.0 months in January 2024.\r\n“More housing supply allows strongly qualified buyers to enter the market,” Yun added. “But for many consumers, both increased inventory and lower mortgage rates are necessary for them to purchase a different home or become first-time homeowners.”\r\nThe median existing-home price[3] for all housing types in January was $396,900, up 4.8% from one year ago ($378,600). All four U.S. regions registered price increases.\r\nREALTORS® Confidence Index\r\nAccording to the monthly REALTORS® Confidence Index, properties typically remained on the market for 41 days in January, up from 35 days in December and 36 days in January 2024.\r\nFirst-time buyers were responsible for 28% of sales in January, down from 31% in December 2024 and identical to January 2024. NAR’s 2024 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers – released November 2024[4] – found that the annual share of first-time buyers was 24%, the lowest ever recorded.\r\nCash sales accounted for 29% of transactions in January, up from 28% in December but down from 32% in January 2024.\r\nIndividual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, purchased 17% of homes in January, up from 16% in December and unchanged from January 2024.\r\nDistressed sales[5] – foreclosures and short sales – represented 3% of sales in January, virtually unchanged from December and the previous year.\r\nMortgage Rates\r\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.85% as of February 20. That’s down from 6.87% one week ago and 6.90% one year ago.\r\nSingle-family and Condo/Co-op Sales\r\nSingle-family home sales declined 5.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.68 million in January, up 2.2% from the previous year. The median existing single-family home price was $402,000 in January, up 5.0% from January 2024.\r\nExisting condominium and co-op sales faded 2.4% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 400,000 units, identical to one year ago. The median existing condo price was $349,500 in January, up 2.9% from the prior year ($339,500).\r\nRegional Breakdown\r\nIn January, existing-home sales in the Northeast waned 5.7% from December to an annual rate of 500,000, up 4.2% from January 2024. The median price in the Northeast was $475,400, up 9.5% from one year earlier.\r\nIn the Midwest, existing-home sales were unchanged in January at an annual rate of 1 million, up 5.3% from the previous year. The median price in the Midwest was $290,400, up 7.2% from January 2024.\r\nExisting-home sales in the South fell 6.2% from December to an annual rate of 1.83 million in January, identical to one year before. The median price in the South was $356,300, up 3.5% from last year.\r\nIn the West, existing-home sales slumped 7.4% in January to an annual rate of 750,000, up 1.4% from a year ago. The median price in the West was $614,200, up 7.4% from January 2024.\r\nAbout the National Association of Realtors®\r\nAs America’s largest trade association, the National Association of Realtors® is involved in all aspects of residential and commercial real estate. The term Realtor® is a registered collective membership mark that identifies a real estate professional who is a member of the National Association of Realtors® and subscribes to its strict Code of Ethics. For free consumer guides about navigating the homebuying and selling transaction processes – from written buyer agreements to negotiating compensation – visit facts.realtor.\n\n# # #\n\nFor local information, please contact the local association of Realtors® for data from local multiple listing services (MLS). Local MLS data is the most accurate source of sales and price information in specific areas, although there may be differences in reporting methodology.\r\nNOTE: NAR’s Pending Home Sales Index for January will be released February 27, and Existing-Home Sales for February will be released March 20. Release times are 10 a.m. Eastern. See NAR’s statistical news release schedule.\n\nInformation about NAR is available at nar.realtor. This and other news releases are posted in the newsroom at nar.realtor/newsroom. Statistical data in this release, as well as other tables and surveys, are posted in the “Research and Statistics” tab.\n\n[1] Existing-home sales, which include single-family, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, are based on transaction closings from Multiple Listing Services. Changes in sales trends outside of MLSs are not captured in the monthly series. NAR benchmarks home sales periodically using other sources to assess overall home sales trends, including sales not reported by MLSs.\r\nExisting-home sales, based on closings, differ from the U.S. Census Bureau’s series on new single-family home sales, which are based on contracts or the acceptance of a deposit. Because of these differences, it is not uncommon for each series to move in different directions in the same month. In addition, existing-home sales, which account for more than 90% of total home sales, are based on a much larger data sample – about 40% of multiple listing service data each month – and typically are not subject to large prior-month revisions.\r\n The annual rate for a particular month represents what the total number of actual sales for a year would be if the relative pace for that month were maintained for 12 consecutive months. Seasonally- adjusted annual rates are used in reporting monthly data to factor out seasonal variations in resale activity. For example, home sales volume is normally higher in the summer than in the winter, primarily because of differences in the weather and family buying patterns. However, seasonal factors cannot compensate for abnormal weather patterns.\r\n Single-family data collection began monthly in 1968, while condo data collection began quarterly in 1981; the series were combined in 1999 when monthly collection of condo data began. Prior to this period, single-family homes accounted for more than nine out of 10 purchases. Historic comparisons for total home sales prior to 1999 are based on monthly single-family sales, combined with the corresponding quarterly sales rate for condos.\n\n[2] Total inventory and month’s supply data are available back through 1999, while single-family inventory and month’s supply are available back to 1982 (prior to 1999, single-family sales accounted for more than 90% of transactions and condos were measured only on a quarterly basis).\n\n[3] The median price is where half sold for more and half sold for less; medians are more typical of market conditions than average prices, which are skewed higher by a relatively small share of upper-end transactions. The only valid comparisons for median prices are with the same period a year earlier due to seasonality in buying patterns. Month-to-month comparisons do not compensate for seasonal changes, especially for the timing of family buying patterns. Changes in the composition of sales can distort median price data. Year-ago median and mean prices sometimes are revised in an automated process if additional data is received.\r\nThe national median condo/co-op price often is higher than the median single-family home price because condos are concentrated in higher-cost housing markets. However, in a given area, single-family homes typically sell for more than condos as seen in NAR’s quarterly metro area price reports.\n\n[4] Survey results represent owner-occupants and differ from separately reported monthly findings from NAR’s REALTORS® Confidence Index, which include all types of buyers. The annual study only represents primary residence purchases, and does not include investor and vacation home buyers. Results include both new and existing homes.\n\n[5] Distressed sales (foreclosures and short sales), days on market, first-time buyers, all-cash transactions and investors are from a monthly survey for the NAR’s REALTORS® Confidence Index, posted at nar.realtor.\n\nAttachment\n\nInfographic",

      "content": "Toronto, Feb.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greater Toronto Area, February 21, 2025 – Greater Toronto Area (GTA) new home sales stayed low in January, but with prices low and inventory steady, these conditions create a unique buying opportunity, the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD) announced today.\n\nThere were 347 new home sales in January which was down 40 per cent from January 2024 and 77 per cent below the 10-year average, according to Altus Group*, BILD’s official source for new home market intelligence.\n\n“January 2025 new home sales across the GTA recorded a near record low,” said Edward Jegg, Research Manager at Altus Group. “Despite a further Bank of Canada cut, excessive inventory and falling prices, GTA new home buyers are nowhere to be found.”\n\nCondominium apartments, including units in low, medium and high-rise buildings, accounted for 101 units sold in the GTA in January, down 58 per cent from January 2024 and 88 per cent below the 10-year average.\n\nThere were 246 single-family home sales in the GTA in January, down 27 per cent from January 2024 and 63 per cent below the 10-year average. Single-family homes include detached, linked and semi-detached houses and townhouses (excluding stacked townhouses).\n\nNew for 2025, BILD and Altus Group are now reporting on sales in Simcoe County. In January, there were 47 total new home sales in Simcoe, 41 single-family home sales and six condominium apartments. The weighted average price for new condominium apartments in Simcoe County was $857,338 and for single-family homes was $1,115,176.\n\nTotal new home remaining inventory in the GTA decreased slightly compared to the previous month, to 21,505 units. This includes 16,906 condominium apartment units and 4,599 single-family dwellings. This represents a combined inventory level of 14 months, based on average sales for the last 12 months.\n\n“With spring on the horizon, now is a prime time for new home buyers to step into the market. Prices have dropped approximately 20% from the peak in 2022, and with interest rates easing, buyers have a unique opportunity to secure a new home at a favorable price,” said Justin Sherwood, Senior Vice President of Communications, Research, and Stakeholder Relations. “However, it is important to recognize that the ‘cost to build’ a new home remains high, due to fixed factors like labour and material costs. This means we are likely at the floor on prices. With current inventory levels, the market is also offering more choice than ever, but this combination of lower prices and reduced interest rates may not last long. For buyers, now is an ideal time to act before conditions shift again.\"\n\nBenchmark prices decreased in January for both single-family homes and condominium apartments in the GTA compared to the previous year. The benchmark price for new condominium apartments was $1,015,231, which was down 3.5 per cent over the last 12 months. The benchmark price for new single-family homes was $1,552,846, which was down 1.2 per cent over the last 12 months.\n\nWith more than 1,000 member companies, BILD is the voice of the home building, residential and non-residential land development and professional renovation industries in the Greater Toronto Area.

      "title": "BESREMi Achieves Strong Market Growth Amid Rising Demand for Polycythemia Vera Treatment",
      "content": "New York, USA, Feb.  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BESREMi Achieves Strong Market Growth Amid Rising Demand for Polycythemia Vera Treatment\n\nBESREMi is a preferred, FDA-approved option for both symptomatic low- and high-risk polycythemia vera patients. In the polycythemia vera space, BESREMi faces competition from drugs like ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, and hydroxyurea. However, BESREMi differentiates itself by being a potentially more tolerable, non-myelosuppressive therapy with a lower risk of treatment-related malignancies.\n\nDelveInsight’s “BESREMi Market Size, Forecast, and Market Insight Report” highlights the details around BESREMi, which is approved for polycythemia vera and in late-stage development for essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. The report also highlights the historical and forecasted sales from 2020 to 2034 segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nPharmaEssentia/AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals’ BESREMi (ropeginterferon alfa-2B/AOP2014/P1101)\n\nBESREMi is an innovative, monopegylated, long-acting interferon designed for extended activity in the body. Utilizing advanced pegylation technology, it allows for administration every two weeks or, with at least a year of hematological stability, every four weeks—providing flexible dosing to accommodate individual patient needs.\n\nBESREMi’s unique mechanism of action targets the JAK2 V617F mutation, commonly found in polycythemia vera patients, making it a compelling treatment alternative. BESREMi promotes hematologic responses, reduces spleen size, and normalizes hematocrit levels while lowering the risk of leukemogenesis compared to cytoreductive therapies like hydroxyurea.\n\nIn the US, BESREMi holds orphan drug designation for polycythemia vera treatment in adults. BESREMi was approved in the U.S. in Q4 2021, leading to significant sales beginning in 2022. Before its US launch, the drug had been approved in the EU in 2019 and became available in Germany, France, and the UK in 2020. In April 2022, Italy’s National Health Service (SSN) granted reimbursement approval. Japan approved BESREMi in 2023, followed by approvals in Canada and Malaysia in 2024.\n\nIn February 2024, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) have recently been updated to include BESREMi, as a preferred first-line cytoreductive therapy option for the treatment of adults with symptomatic, low-risk PV.\n\nBESREMi gained US approval in 2021 with an annual price of more than USD 180,000, whereas in certain EU countries, annual pricing range from USD 60,000–110,000. To date, the drug has been approved in around 40 countries worldwide. Common side effects of BESREMi include flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions, fatigue, headache, nausea, anemia, and liver function abnormalities.\n\nBESREMi has demonstrated strong efficacy, inducing complete hematologic responses, high clinical response rates, and significant molecular responses that may slow disease progression. It has also shown the ability to reduce the allelic burden of both JAK2 and non-JAK2 mutations, which are linked to disease advancement.\n\nPharmaEssentia is committed to advancing MPN treatment through the ongoing development of BESREMi. Beyond polycythemia vera, the drug is being investigated for additional indications, including essential thrombocythemia, early myelofibrosis, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), adult T-cell leukemia, and more.\n\nIn June 2023, PharmaEssentia Corporation announced that it had entered into an exclusive license agreement with Pint-Pharma GmbH for the registration and promotion of BESREMi in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico.\n\nDrug NameBESREMiMolecule typeRecombinant proteinDeveloperPharmaEssentia/AOP Orphan PharmaceuticalsApprovalUS: 2021; EU: 2019; JP: 2023Primary indicationsPolycythemia VeraMechanism of actionInterferon alpha-2 replacementRoute of administrationSubcutaneous (SC)\n\nLearn more about BESREMi projected market size for polycythemia vera @ BESREMi Market Potential\n\nPolycythemia Vera is an uncommon condition characterized by a persistent increase in red blood cell count, often accompanied by elevated levels of white blood cells and platelets. It is the most frequently occurring myeloproliferative neoplasm and the only one specifically linked to excessive red blood cell production. In 2024, the estimated number of prevalent polycythemia vera cases in the United States was approximately 182,000, with around 73,000 individuals being asymptomatic, according to DelveInsight.\n\nWhile there is no cure for polycythemia vera, various treatment options exist to help manage the disease and its complications. Treatment typically involves a combination of medical procedures, medications, and other therapeutic approaches. Currently, two FDA-approved drugs are available for managing the condition: JAKAFI and BESREMi, both of which are also approved in Europe and Japan.\n\nThe treatment landscape for polycythemia vera is evolving, with new developments shaping its future. According to DelveInsight, the market for polycythemia vera across the seven major markets is projected to expand from USD 1.9 billion in 2024, with a substantial CAGR through 2034. This growth is primarily driven by the emergence of novel therapies, improved early detection strategies, advancements in secondary care treatments, ongoing clinical research, and increasing awareness of the disease.\n\nDiscover more about the polycythemia vera market in detail @ Polycythemia Vera Market Report\n\nEmerging Competitors of BESREMi\n\nDue to its distinct mechanism of action compared to JAKAFI and BESREMi, Protagonist Therapeutics’rusfertide has the potential to serve as an earlier-line treatment option for polycythemia vera. It may offer an advantage over existing polycythemia vera therapies, given the severe side effects associated with JAK inhibitors. Current data suggests that rusfertide could emerge as the new standard of care, as it significantly reduces the need for phlebotomy, which directly impacts patients' quality of life.\n\nOther key companies developing drugs in the polycythemia vera space include Italfarmaco (DUVYZAT), Ionis Pharmaceuticals (Sapablursen), Merck (Bomedemstat), Silence Therapeutics (Divesiran), and others. In the myelofibrosis space, key players include AbbVie, Merck, Geron Corporation, and MorphoSys. For essential thrombocythemia, Merck, and MorphoSys are prominent competitors.\n\nApart from these emerging drugs, BESREMi will get competition from the already approved drugs for respective indications. In the polycythemia vera therapeutic space, Incyte/Novartis’s JAKAFI is a tough competitor to BESREMi whereas if approved for myelofibrosis, it will get direct competition from GSK’s OJJAARA, BMS’ INREBIC, and others.\n\nTo know more about the number of competing drugs in development, visit @ BESREMi Market Positioning Compared to Other Drugs\n\nBESREMi Patent Details\n\nIn January 2022, the US FDA informed the company that as the first sponsor of this drug to obtain marketing approval for this indication, the company is entitled to 7 years of orphan-drug exclusive approval for ropeginterferon alfa-2b for adults with polycythemia vera. The 7-year exclusive approval began on November 12, 2021, the date of marketing approval. The patent for BESREMi is expected to expire in 2034, allowing generics to enter the polycythemia vera treatment market and hint at a rapid decline in revenue.\n\nDive deeper to get more insight into BESREMi’s strengths & weaknesses relative to competitors @ BESREMi Market Drug Report\n\nBESREMi Market Dynamics\n\nThe treatment landscape for polycythemia vera has evolved significantly, shifting from conventional approaches like aspirin, hydroxyurea, interferons, and phlebotomy to more advanced therapies, including JAKAFI (approved in 2014) and BESREMi (approved in 2021). BESREMi, an interferon specifically targeting the JAK2 V617F mutation, is now recognized as first-line cytoreductive therapy in the updated NCCN guidelines. Its advantages include achieving hematologic response, lowering leukemogenic risk, and offering a convenient long-acting dosing regimen. BESREMi has been approved in multiple regions, including the EU and the US, for polycythemia vera treatment, backed by strong clinical data demonstrating its effectiveness in hematocrit reduction and overall disease management.\n\nIn the polycythemia vera treatment space, BESREMi competes with drugs like ruxolitinib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor) and hydroxyurea. However, it differentiates itself as a potentially more tolerable, non-myelosuppressive option with a lower risk of treatment-related malignancies. Its long-acting formulation gives it an edge over ruxolitinib, which requires twice-daily dosing. Despite the competition, BESREMi has been well-received by both physicians and patients due to its manageable side effect profile and ability to address limitations associated with traditional treatments.\n\nSince BESREMi is positioned earlier in the treatment pathway than JAKAFI in NCCN guidelines, it does not directly compete with JAKAFI. However, its ability to delay disease progression and reduce the need for JAKAFI could impact JAKAFI’s overall revenue.\n\nBESREMi is expected to reach peak adoption in the US by 2027 before late-stage competitors like rusfertide gain a foothold. Our analysis suggests that BESREMi will maintain a competitive lead for at least five years before new entrants like rusfertide establish themselves. Furthermore, with BESREMi’s patent set to expire in 2034, the eventual introduction of generics could lead to a sharp revenue decline. The market dynamics are expected to shift in the coming years due to increased first-line use of BESREMi for polycythemia vera, the anticipated launch of a pen-device version, potential expansion into additional indications, and broader global availability.\n\nDiscover how BESREMi is shaping the polycythemia vera treatment landscape @ BESREMi Polycythemia Vera\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1Report Introduction2BESREMi: PharmaEssentia/AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals2.1Product Overview2.2Other Development Activities2.3Clinical Development2.4Clinical Trials Information2.5Safety and Efficacy2.6Product Profile2.7Market Assessment2.7.1The 7MM Analysis2.7.1.1Cost Assumptions and Rebate2.7.1.2Pricing Trends2.7.1.3Analogue Assessment2.7.1.4Launch Year and Therapy Uptake2.7.2The United States Market Analysis2.7.3EU4 and the United Kingdom Market Analysis2.7.3.1Germany2.7.3.2France2.7.3.3Italy2.7.3.4Spain2.7.3.5UK2.7.4Japan Market Analysis2.8Market Drivers2.9Market Barriers2.10SWOT Analysis3Key Cross of Marketed Competitors of BESREMi4Key Cross of Emerging Competitors of BESREMi\n\nRelated Reports\n\nPolycythemia Vera Market\n\nPolycythemia Vera Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast – 2034 report delivers an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key polycythemia vera companies, including Incyte, Novartis, PharmaEssentia, AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals, Protagonist Therapeutics, Merck (Imago BioSciences), Italfarmaco, Ionis Pharmaceutical, Silence Therapeutics, Perseus Proteomics, AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, Mabwell (Shanghai) Bioscience, Disc Medicine, GluBio Therapeutics, among others.\n\nPolycythemia Vera Pipeline\n\nPolycythemia Vera Pipeline Insight – 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key polycythemia vera companies, including Silence Therapeutics, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Perseus Proteomics, Kartos Therapeutics, Disc Medicine, among others.\n\nPolycythemia Vera Epidemiology\n\nPolycythemia Vera Epidemiology Forecast – 2034 report delivers an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted polycythemia vera epidemiology in the 7MM, i.e., the United States, EU5 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom), and Japan.\n\nPost-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis Market\n\nPost-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast – 2034 report delivers an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis companies, including Kartos Therapeutics, Inc., Parexel, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Incyte Corporation, NS Pharma, Inc., Celgene, Lynk Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, Imago BioSciences, Inc., Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc, AbbVie Inc, Acceleron Pharma Inc, Actuate Therapeutics Inc, Bristol Myers Squibb Co, CTI BioPharma Corp, F.

The monoclonal antibody component of the ADC is engineered to recognize and bind to specific antigens found on the surface of cancer cells. Once bound, the ADC is internalized into the cancer cell, where the cytotoxic drug is released, delivering a highly targeted dose of chemotherapy directly to the tumor. This approach helps to minimize the systemic toxicity commonly associated with traditional chemotherapy, as the drug is delivered specifically to cancer cells rather than affecting healthy tissues.\n\nThe development of ADCs has led to significant advancements in cancer treatment, particularly for tumors that are resistant to conventional therapies. ADCs are designed to overcome some of the challenges in cancer therapy, such as off-target toxicity and drug resistance, by ensuring that the cytotoxic payload is only active inside cancer cells. However, the design and optimization of ADCs remain complex, involving careful selection of the monoclonal antibody, the cytotoxic drug, and the linker that connects them. Ongoing research is focused on improving the stability, potency, and selectivity of ADCs to enhance their therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects.\n\nAntibody-drug Conjugates Epidemiology Segmentation\n\nAs per DelveInsight analysis, the total incident cases of TNBC in the United States comprised nearly 45K cases in 2023. The total number of incident cases of NSCLC in the 7MM were ~531K cases in 2023  which is expected to grow during the forecast period 2024–2034. Estimates show that the highest incident population of NSCLC is in the United States followed by Japan.

      "content": "New York, USA, Feb.  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epilepsy Market Assessment in the 7MM by 2034 — A Detailed Analysis of Growth Prospects Across Different Types | DelveInsight\n\nAccording to DelveInsight’s analysis, the epilepsy market is expected to grow due to an increase in disease prevalence and the expected launch of emerging therapies such as Xenon Pharmaceutical’s XEN1101, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals’s BHV-7000, Takeda/Ovid Therapeutics’s Soticlestat (TAK-935), and UCB Pharma’s STACCATO alprazolam (benzodiazepine), among others during the forecast period.\n\nEpilepsy is a long-term neurological disorder that affects individuals of all ages, leading to recurrent and unprovoked seizures. These seizures result from sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain, which can cause convulsions, altered consciousness, or unusual sensations and behaviors.\n\nAs per DelveInsight analysis, in 2023, the total diagnosed prevalent cases of epilepsy were nearly 7 million in the 7MM. These cases are projected to increase due to the increased aging global population where older adults are more susceptible to conditions such as stroke, dementia, and epilepsy during the forecast period (2024-2034).\n\nDiagnosing epilepsy requires a thorough evaluation, including clinical and physical examinations, as well as various diagnostic tests. Imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans help assess brain structure, while electroencephalography (EEG) detects abnormal electrical activity. Blood tests and additional assessments may also be conducted to identify potential underlying causes. This multidisciplinary approach aims to confirm the diagnosis, classify seizure types, determine severity, and develop personalized treatment plans.\n\nEpilepsy management focuses on reducing seizure frequency, improving quality of life, and addressing associated challenges, though no treatment offers a complete cure. A wide range of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is available, including generic options like lamotrigine, sodium valproate, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate. More recently approved treatments include XCOPRI, FYCOMPA, LIBERVANT, NAYZILAM, EPIDIOLEX, BRIVIACT, and SYMPAZAN.\n\nFirst-line monotherapy AEDs work by modulating sodium channels, GABA receptors, calcium channels, or synaptic vesicle protein SV2A. Second-line treatments may involve monotherapy or combination AEDs, while adjunctive therapies include options such as EPIDIOLEX (cannabidiol) and FINTEPLA (fenfluramine).\n\nThe total market size of epilepsy in the 7MM is estimated to be around USD 9 billion in 2023. This is expected to increase further by 2034. Market dynamics are projected to shift in the forecast period due to the introduction of new therapies such as XEN1101, Soticlestat (TAK-935), BHV-7000 (KB-3061), PRAX-562, STACCATO alprazolam (benzodiazepine), and others, increased awareness of epilepsy among healthcare providers and the general population, and advancements in diagnostic technologies.\n\nDiscover more about the epilepsy market in detail @ Epilepsy Market Report\n\nDelveInsight has expertise in the neurological disorders market, and an experienced team handles the neurological disorders domain proficiently. DelveInsight has recently released a series of epidemiology-based market reports on different types of epilepsy including Partial Epilepsy, Chronic Focal Epilepsy, and Drug-Resistant Epilepsy. These reports include a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, emerging drugs, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted market size from 2020 to 2034  segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nAdditionally, the reports feature an examination of prominent companies working with their lead candidates in different stages of clinical development. Let’s deep dive into the market assessment of these epilepsy types individually.\n\nPartial Epilepsy Market\n\nPartial epilepsy, also known as focal epilepsy, is a neurological condition characterized by seizures that originate in a specific area of the brain. Unlike generalized epilepsy, where seizures affect both hemispheres, focal seizures may be localized or spread to nearby regions. Symptoms can vary widely depending on the affected brain area, ranging from motor disturbances and sensory changes to autonomic dysfunctions and cognitive impairments. Partial epilepsy is further classified into simple focal seizures and complex focal seizures. It remains a significant concern due to its impact on quality of life, often requiring long-term management.\n\nPartial epilepsy is one of the most common types of epilepsy, accounting for approximately 60% of all epilepsy cases worldwide. It affects people of all ages but is more prevalent in individuals with brain injuries, infections, tumors, or genetic predispositions. Current treatment options primarily involve anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) that help control seizures, with options like carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and lacosamide being widely prescribed.\n\nHowever, nearly one-third of patients develop drug-resistant epilepsy, necessitating alternative approaches such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), or surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone.\n\nIn recent years, several emerging drugs have been investigated for partial epilepsy, focusing on novel mechanisms to improve seizure control and reduce side effects. Cenobamate (XCOPRI) has gained FDA approval for focal seizures in adults and has shown superior efficacy compared to existing AEDs. Other pipeline drugs include XEN1101, a novel potassium channel opener with promising Phase 2 results, and new formulations of cannabidiol (CBD) targeting drug-resistant cases. Advances in precision medicine and gene therapies are also being explored to offer personalized treatment options for refractory epilepsy.\n\nFor a comprehensive view of the partial epilepsy market, check out the Focal Epilepsy Market Assessment\n\nChronic Focal Epilepsy Market\n\nChronic focal epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, localized seizures originating in a specific area of the brain. Unlike generalized epilepsy, which affects both hemispheres, focal epilepsy involves abnormal electrical activity in a limited region, leading to symptoms such as sensory disturbances, motor impairments, and altered consciousness. The condition can be caused by structural brain abnormalities, trauma, infections, or genetic factors. It is typically diagnosed through electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging techniques like MRI.\n\nWhile the prevalence varies by region, it is estimated that around 1% of the global population has active epilepsy, with a significant proportion suffering from focal seizures. The condition can be particularly challenging to manage in patients who do not respond well to first-line treatments, leading to drug-resistant epilepsy in nearly 30% of cases. The current treatment landscape for focal epilepsy includes several approved AEDs such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and lacosamide, which help control seizures by modulating neurotransmission.\n\nThe market for chronic focal epilepsy treatments is evolving, driven by the growing prevalence of epilepsy, the increasing adoption of novel therapies, and ongoing R&D in precision medicine. Emerging drugs in the pipeline include next-generation sodium channel blockers, glutamate receptor modulators, and gene therapies targeting specific genetic mutations associated with epilepsy.\n\nCompanies are also exploring disease-modifying approaches to alter the progression of focal epilepsy rather than just controlling seizures. With a rising focus on personalized medicine and drug-resistant epilepsy solutions, the chronic focal epilepsy market is expected to witness steady growth in the coming years.\n\nDiscover more about chronic focal epilepsy drugs in development @ Chronic Focal Epilepsy Clinical Trials\n\nDrug-Resistant Epilepsy Market\n\nDrug-resistant epilepsy, also known as intractable or refractory epilepsy, is characterized by the failure to achieve long-term seizure control despite adequate trials of two well-tolerated, appropriately selected, and correctly administered antiepileptic drug regimens, either as monotherapy or in combination.\n\nDrug-resistant epilepsy is the most common in adults compared to children. Nearly 7% to 20% of children have drug-resistant epilepsy. Meanwhile, 30% to 40% of adult patients remain refractory to pharmacological treatment. Refractory epilepsy may result from poor treatment adherence, improper drug selection or dosage, or the presence of nonepileptic attack disorder rather than true epilepsy. However, some seizures remain unresponsive to standard therapies.\n\nPharmacological treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy primarily relies on AEDs. Clinical studies indicate that patients who do not respond to two AEDs have a low likelihood of success with additional AEDs, often requiring higher doses, which contributes to drug resistance. AEDs encompass various classes, including Sodium Channel Modulators, GABA Receptor Modulators, Calcium Channel Blockers, Receptor Blockers, and Combination Therapies. Among these, Sodium Channel Modulators and SV2A vesicle inhibitors are commonly prescribed.\n\nSeveral types of molecules are used to manage drug-resistant epilepsy. One such drug is Phenytoin, which has a chemical structure similar to barbiturates. It functions by binding to inactivated voltage-gated sodium channels after depolarization, thereby reducing inward sodium flow and altering sodium permeability. Another commonly used AED is Carbamazepine, structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Its carbamyl group plays a crucial role in its strong antiseizure effects. Carbamazepine is primarily prescribed as an anticonvulsant.\n\nOxcarbazepine is thought to exert its antiepileptic effects by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels and reducing presynaptic glutamate release. It is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for focal epilepsy, generally preferred over carbamazepine due to its better tolerability and lower risk of drug interactions. Lamotrigine, another powerful antiepileptic drug (AED) from the phenyltriazine class, is chemically distinct from other AEDs.\n\nDietary therapies, particularly the Ketogenic diet, are often recommended by physicians for epilepsy management, especially in children. This diet, which is high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates, is typically initiated within a few days. A less restrictive alternative, the Modified Atkins diet, is also used. These dietary approaches may help control seizures by lowering blood sugar and insulin levels while increasing ketone production. Additionally, lifestyle modifications can help reduce seizure triggers.\n\nSome of the drugs in the pipeline include NRTX-1001 (Neurona Therapeutics), IAMA-6 (IAMA Therapeutics), iQ-007 (iQure Pharma), and others. The expected launch of these drugs will surge the drug-resistant epilepsy market growth.\n\nOverall, the drug-resistant epilepsy therapeutics market is further expected to increase by the major drivers such as the rising prevalent population, technological advancements, and upcoming therapies in the forecast period.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the drug-resistant epilepsy market, be sure to explore the Refractory Epilepsy Market Outlook\n\nAbout DelveInsight\n\nDelveInsight is a leading Business Consultant and Market Research firm focused exclusively on life sciences.

      "content": "New York, USA, Feb.  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market to Register Incremental Growth During the Study Period (2020–2034) Owing to the Launch of Emerging Therapies | DelveInsight\n\nAccording to DelveInsight’s analysis, the chronic spontaneous urticaria market is expected to increase due to an increase in disease prevalence, complemented by a rise in awareness and improvements in diagnosis and the expected launch of emerging therapies during the forecast period.\n\nDelveInsight’s Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Insights report includes a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, emerging chronic spontaneous urticaria drugs, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted chronic spontaneous urticaria market size from 2020 to 2034, segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nKey Takeaways from the Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Report\n\nAccording to      DelveInsight’s analysis, the market size of chronic spontaneous urticaria      in the 7MM was USD 2.1 billion in 2023.The US accounts for      the largest market size capturing approximately 55% of the total      CSU market in 2023, in comparison to EU4 and the UK and Japan.As per DelveInsight      analysis, there were 4.1 million diagnosed prevalent cases of      chronic urticaria, in the 7MM, in 2023. These cases are projected to      increase during the forecast period (2024-2034).Prominent companies      working in the domain of chronic spontaneous urticaria, including Novartis      Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, Regeneron, Celldex Therapeutics, Jasper      Therapeutics, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Allakos, and others, are actively      working on innovative chronic spontaneous urticaria drugs. These novel      chronic spontaneous urticaria therapies are anticipated to enter the      chronic spontaneous urticaria market in the forecast period and are      expected to change the market.Some of the key      chronic spontaneous urticaria treatments include Remibrutinib (LOU064),      DUPIXENT (dupilumab), Rilzabrutinib (SAR444671), Barzolvolimab (CDX-0159),      Briquilimab (JSP191), TAS5315, and others. In October 2024,      Jasper Therapeutics announced the launch of an open-label extension      study for CSU, enrolling patients from the BEACON and SPOTLIGHT trials      after their initial follow-up. The company also received regulatory      approval in the US and EU to add a 360mg single-dose cohort (n=4) to the      BEACON study in CSU. Initial data from doses up to 240mg will be reported      in January 2025, with 360mg cohort data expected in the first half of      2025.\n\nDiscover which therapies are expected to grab the chronic spontaneous urticaria market share @ Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Report\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Overview\n\nChronic urticaria can either be spontaneous or triggered by certain factors, lasting for more than six weeks and persisting for over a year. It significantly affects the quality of life and is associated with psychiatric conditions and high healthcare expenses, often resulting in considerable socio-economic challenges for patients. Unlike chronic spontaneous urticaria, where the cause remains unclear, chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) has identifiable and specific triggers that cause the symptoms.\n\nThe exact cause of CSU is not fully understood, but it is believed to be linked to autoimmune reactions, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells. Diagnosis is primarily based on a physical exam and medical history, with additional tests such as blood work, allergy testing, or skin biopsies to exclude other causes or identify triggers. The condition can lead to the formation of large \"wheals,\" sometimes several centimeters in diameter, which often resolve within 24 hours of onset.\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Epidemiology Segmentation\n\nThe chronic spontaneous urticaria epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current chronic spontaneous urticaria patient pool and forecasted trends for the 7MM. It helps recognize the causes of current and forecasted patient trends by exploring numerous studies and views of key opinion leaders.\n\nThe chronic spontaneous urticaria market report proffers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020–2034 in the 7MM segmented into:\n\nTotal Diagnosed      Prevalent Cases of Chronic UrticariaType-specific Cases      of Chronic UrticariaGender-specific      Cases of CSUAge-specific Cases      of CSUSeverity-specific      Cases of CSU\n\nDownload the report to understand which factors are driving chronic spontaneous urticaria epidemiology trends @ Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Epidemiological Insights\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Treatment Market\n\nManaging chronic spontaneous urticaria is difficult, with the main therapeutic objectives being reduced disease activity, complete symptom control, and enhanced quality of life (QoL). The current treatment approach focuses on symptom relief and preventing recurrence. Typically, treatment follows a step-by-step strategy, starting with first-line options and advancing to more specialized therapies if needed.\n\nIn March 2023, the US FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for DUPIXENT (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who do not respond well to the current standard treatment, H1 antihistamines. However, in October 2023, Sanofi and Regeneron announced they had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the US FDA. The CRL indicated that additional efficacy data are needed for approval but did not raise any concerns about safety or manufacturing. An ongoing clinical trial (Study C) is still recruiting patients, with results expected in late 2024 to provide the required efficacy data.\n\nIn February 2024, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) approved DUPIXENT for CSU treatment in individuals aged 12 and older whose condition is inadequately controlled with existing therapies. Japan became the first country to approve Dupixent for CSU, underscoring its importance as a novel treatment for patients with unmet medical needs.\n\nNovartis and Genentech’s (Roche) XOLAIR is an approved monoclonal antibody (MAB) for CSU patients aged 12 and older who continue to experience symptoms despite H1-antihistamine treatment. It helps prevent wheal and angioedema formation, enhances QoL, is suitable for long-term use, and effectively manages relapses after stopping treatment.\n\nLearn more about the market of chronic spontaneous urticaria @ Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Treatment\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Emerging Drugs and Companies\n\nExpected launch of emerging therapies, such as remibrutinib (LOU064) (Novartis Pharmaceuticals), DUPIXENT (dupilumab) (Sanofi/Regeneron), Barzolvolimab (Celldex Therapeutics), etc shall create a positive impact on the market. Other therapies by Sanofi, Jasper Therapeutics, Allakos, etc. in the early stages, are also being developed.\n\nRemibrutinib is an oral medication that effectively and selectively targets Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), an enzyme crucial to the inflammatory functions of immune cells like B cells and microglia. It inhibits IgE-mediated degranulation in mast cells and basophils, as well as the activation induced by factors in the sera of patients with spontaneous and inducible chronic urticaria. In the Phase III REMIX-1 and REMIX-2 trials, remibrutinib demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant reduction in weekly urticaria activity (UAS7), itch (ISS7), and hives (HSS7) at Week 12 compared to a placebo.\n\nThe drug was well-tolerated, with an overall safety profile similar to that of the placebo, and showed balanced liver function tests across both trials. In May 2024, Novartis released additional data confirming remibrutinib’s long-term efficacy and safety in chronic spontaneous urticaria. These findings were presented at the 2024 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Congress in Valencia, Spain, and Novartis plans to submit remibrutinib for approval in CSU to global health authorities in the second half of 2024 while continuing to explore its use in other immune-related conditions.\n\nDUPIXENT is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that blocks interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by binding to the IL-4Rα subunit, which is common to both IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. It inhibits IL-4 signaling through the ‘Type I’ receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the ‘Type II’ receptor. Various cell types express IL-4Rα. DUPIXENT is approved for several indications, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis.\n\nIn July 2021, the Phase III trial successfully met its primary and key secondary endpoints at 24 weeks, showing that DUPIXENT nearly doubled the reduction in itch and urticaria activity scores. Sanofi and Regeneron submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for DUPIXENT for chronic spontaneous urticaria, but the US FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) requiring additional efficacy data for approval. The drug is currently undergoing Phase III trials in patients who are either naïve to omalizumab or intolerant to/incomplete responders of omalizumab, with results expected in late 2024 for DUPIXENT in biologic-naïve chronic spontaneous urticaria patients.\n\nBarzolvolimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, effectively inhibiting its function. KIT is found in various cell types, including mast cells, which are key players in inflammatory processes like hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. KIT signaling is essential for the differentiation, recruitment, survival, and activity of mast cells. Inflammatory conditions such as chronic urticaria are driven by mast cell activation, which is critical to the disease's onset and progression.\n\nIn June 2024, Celldex Therapeutics reported that Barzolvolimab significantly improved angioedema-free days compared to a placebo over 12 weeks. Patients in the 300 mg group were free of angioedema for 77% of the time during this period. Following these positive outcomes, Celldex launched its global Phase III program in July 2024, consisting of two trials, EMBARQ-CSU1 and EMBARQ-CSU2, to assess the safety and effectiveness of Barzolvolimab in adults with CSU who continue to experience symptoms despite H1 antihistamine treatment.\n\nThe anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the chronic spontaneous urticaria market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the chronic spontaneous urticaria market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth.\n\nTo know more about chronic spontaneous urticaria clinical trials, visit @ Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Treatment Drugs\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Dynamics\n\nThe chronic spontaneous urticaria market dynamics are anticipated to change in the coming years. The advancement in clinical guidelines with GRADE methodologies provides evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for different subtypes of urticaria, while substantial progress in CSU management over the past two decades has introduced multiple treatment options, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and biologic therapies, offering relief to many patients.\n\nMoreover, advancements in medicine enable tailored treatment approaches for CSU, incorporating step-up or step-down strategies based on individual patient characteristics, triggers, and response patterns. This evolving landscape presents a lucrative opportunity to develop safe and effective therapies for patients who remain uncontrolled with existing treatment options.\n\nFurthermore, many potential therapies are being investigated for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact the chronic spontaneous urticaria market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate is expected to drive the growth of the chronic spontaneous urticaria market in the 7MM.\n\nHowever, several factors may impede the growth of the chronic spontaneous urticaria market. The disease's variable presentations, along with patients often providing an incomplete history, contribute to delayed diagnosis and poor treatment outcomes. Additionally, not all patients respond well to the current treatment regime, leading to relapses or inadequate symptom control.\n\nHigher doses of H1-antihistamines are associated with significant side effects, such as sedation and anticholinergic effects, while XOLAIR carries a risk of anaphylaxis. Furthermore, variability in epidemiological data limits research and clinical health interventions. Meanwhile, the expected entry of biosimilars is anticipated to create downward pressure in the market.\n\nMoreover, chronic spontaneous urticaria treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients’ overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, the chronic spontaneous urticaria market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies, unaffordable pricing, market access and reimbursement issues, and a shortage of healthcare specialists. In addition, the undiagnosed, unreported cases and the unawareness about the disease may also impact the chronic spontaneous urticaria market growth.\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Report MetricsDetailsStudy Period2020–2034Chronic   Spontaneous Urticaria Report Coverage7MM [The   United States, the EU-4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United   Kingdom, and Japan]Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria   Market Size in 2023USD 2.1 BillionKey Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria   CompaniesNovartis   Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, Regeneron, Celldex Therapeutics, Jasper   Therapeutics, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Allakos, and othersKey   Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria TherapiesRemibrutinib   (LOU064), DUPIXENT (dupilumab), Rilzabrutinib (SAR444671), Barzolvolimab   (CDX-0159), Briquilimab (JSP191), TAS5315, and others\n\nScope of the Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Report\n\nChronic      Spontaneous Urticaria Therapeutic Assessment: Chronic      Spontaneous Urticaria current marketed and emerging therapiesChronic Spontaneous      UrticariaMarket Dynamics: Conjoint      Analysis of Emerging Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria DrugsCompetitive      Intelligence Analysis: SWOT analysis and Market      entry strategiesUnmet Needs, KOL’s views, Analyst’s      views, Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Access and Reimbursement\n\nDiscover more about chronic spontaneous urticaria drugs in development @ Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Clinical Trials\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Key Insights2.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Report Introduction3.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Overview   at a Glance4.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Executive Summary5.Disease Background and Overview6.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Treatment and   Management7.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Epidemiology and   Patient Population8.Patient Journey9.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Marketed Drugs10.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Emerging Drugs11.Seven Major Chronic   Spontaneous Urticaria Market Analysis12.Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Market Outlook13.Potential of Current and Emerging Therapies14.KOL Views15.Unmet Needs16.SWOT Analysis17.Appendix18.DelveInsight Capabilities19.Disclaimer20.About DelveInsight\n\nRelated Reports\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Pipeline\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Pipeline Insight – 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key chronic spontaneous urticaria companies, including United BioPharma, Teva Pharmaceuticals Development, Inc., Amgen, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Allakos Inc., Sanofi, Celltrion, Celldex Therapeutics, MICROBIO GROUP., Escient Pharmaceuticals, Jasper Therapeutics, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Taiho Pharmaceuticals, ValenzaBio, Carna Biosciences, Servier, among others.\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Epidemiology Forecast\n\nChronic Spontaneous Urticaria Epidemiology Forecast – 2034 report delivers an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted CSU epidemiology in the 7MM, i.e., the United States, EU5 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom), and Japan.\n\nChronic Inducible Urticaria Market\n\nChronic Inducible Urticaria Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast – 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key chronic inducible urticaria companies including Sanofi, Allakos Inc., Celldex Therapeutics, among others.\n\nChronic Inducible Urticaria Pipeline\n\nChronic Inducible Urticaria Pipeline Insight – 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key chronic inducible urticaria companies, including Celldex Therapeutics, Jasper Therapeutics, among others.\n\nUrticaria Pipeline\n\nUrticaria Pipeline Insight – 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key urticaria companies, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Allakos Inc, Yuhan Corporation, United BioPharma, Hangzhou Highlightll Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Celldex Therapeutics, Longbio Pharma, Celltrion, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, among others.\n\nDelveInsight’s Pharma Competitive Intelligence Service: Through its CI solutions, DelveInsight provides its clients with real-time and actionable intelligence on their competitors and markets of interest to keep them stay ahead of the competition by providing insights into the latest therapeutic area-specific/indication-specific market trends, in emerging drugs, and competitive strategies.

      "title": "Inhalation Anesthesia Market Size to Advance USD 2.94 Bn by 2034",
      "content": "Ottawa, Feb.  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global inhalation anesthesia market size was valued at USD 1.54 billion in 2024 and is predicted to hit around USD 2.76 billion by 2033, a study published by Towards Healthcare a sister firm of Precedence Statistics.\n\nBrowse More Insights of Towards Healthcare: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/download-brochure/5416\n\nMarket Overview\n\nThe most often utilized medications for maintaining general anesthesia are inhalation anesthetics. Their pharmacokinetics and manner of administration enable easy reversal and controlled, predictable activity. In the intensive care unit (ICU), sedation is essential to patient treatment. It has many uses in the intensive care unit, such as enabling invasive treatments, assisting with mechanical ventilation, and controlling agitation and anxiety. The increased desire for shorter hospital stays and the growing number of surgical operations are responsible for the market's growth. Inhalation anesthesia provides better results for patients than intravenous anesthesia.\n\nDriving Factors for Inhalation Anesthesia Market Growth\n\nA rise in surgical procedures for aesthetics\n\nThe results of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery's (ISAPS) annual Global Survey on Aesthetic/Cosmetic Procedures revealed a 5.5% increase in surgical procedures, with plastic surgeons performing over 15.8 million procedures and 19.1 million non-surgical procedures. The total rise over the past four years is 40%. With over 2.2 million procedures performed in 2022, liposuction remained the most popular surgical operation in 2023. With over 6.5 million procedures—a 19.6% increase—all face and head treatments demonstrated significant growth from the prior year. The most common surgeries were lip enhancement/perioral treatments (0.9 million, 29% rise), rhinoplasty (1.1 million, 21.6% increase), and eyelids (almost 1.7 million, 24% increase). 5.1 million body and extremity procedures (-0.4%) and 4.1 million breast procedures (-5%).\n\nYou can place an order or ask any questions, please feel free to contact us at sales@towardshealthcare.com\n\nA rise in emergency and surgical intervention\n\nOne of the key factors propelling the inhalation anesthetics market is the increasing number of emergency situations and surgical procedures. There has been a steady increase in the number of emergency medical problems that need prompt surgical intervention, such as accidents and emergency labor. Over 230 million surgeries are carried out globally each year, and a sizable percentage of these call for inhaled anesthetic of some kind, according to the latest figures. There is a significant need for emergency medical interventions, as evidenced by the 130 million emergency hospital visits that occurred in the United States alone, of which 35 million were connected to injuries.\n\nOpportunities in the Inhalation Anesthesia Market\n\nIn July 2024, for SEK 34 million, Swedish MedTech company Sedana Medical (publ.) purchased Innovatif Cekal, its primary inhalation sedation provider.With a product line that includes isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane, Piramal Pharma is a world leader in inhalation anesthesia. Piramal Pharma Ltd.'s second-quarter revenue for 2024 was Rs. 2241.75 crore, up 17.3% over the same period in 2023. At Rs. 22.59 crore, the profit represented a 350% increase over the first quarter of 2024.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nGet the latest insights on healthcare industry segmentation with our Annual Membership: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/get-an-annual-membership\n\nThe presence of top companies drives North America.\n\nNorth America held the largest share of the inhalation anesthesia market in 2024. The focus on medical innovation and improvements is what defines North America. The existence of prominent research institutes, university medical facilities, and innovative pharmaceutical firms creates an atmosphere that is favorable for the creation of novel anesthetics, delivery systems, and monitoring tools. Commons Clinic, for instance, spent $9.75 million in April 2024 to open an innovative spine surgical clinic in the US. A cutting-edge ambulatory surgical platform intended to improve surgical efficiency will be available at the facility. This dedication to innovation not only improves patient care but also encourages medical practitioners to use cutting-edge anesthetic procedures, such as inhalation anesthesia. Its supremacy is also influenced by the region's strict safety regulations and regulatory environment.\n\nIn order to guarantee the security and effectiveness of anesthetic supplies and equipment, regulatory organizations like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are essential. North America's leadership in the sector is cemented by this strict control, which increases patient and healthcare provider trust in the use of inhalation anesthesia. Additionally, North America's emphasis on medical education and training guarantees that anesthesia doctors have the necessary tools to safely and effectively provide inhalation anesthesia.\n\nExpanding medical tourism is driving the Asia Pacific.\n\nAsia Pacific is expected to host the fastest-growing inhalation anesthesia market during the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific inhalation anesthesia market is driven by factors such as growing populations, the need for operations, and the advancement of healthcare infrastructure. According to statistics, over 36% of the world's population lives in nations like China and India, where the number of individuals in need of surgery is on the rise. More procedures are being performed in the area as a result of aocomprisesis, a rising prevalence of chronic diseases, particularly among diabetics, and the danger of cardiovascular issues. Therefore, the growing number of medical tourism destinations in nations like Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand is driving the market's expansion. Furthermore, government programs to provide access to high-quality healthcare and the growing use of sophisticated anesthesia delivery methods guarantee the widespread use of inhalation anesthetics like sevoflurane and halothane.\n\nElevate your healthcare strategy with Towards Healthcare. Enhance efficiency and drive better outcomes—schedule a call today: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/schedule-meeting\n\nMarket Segmentation\n\nBy drug, the sevoflurane segment dominated the inhalation anesthesia market in 2024. The FDA has authorized sevoflurane, a halogenated inhalational anesthetic, for use in inpatient and outpatient surgery to induce and maintain general anesthesia in both adult and pediatric patients. As an inhalation anesthetic, sevoflurane has been used extensively in clinical anesthesia. In recent years, there have been a number of additional uses as medicine has advanced, including combination nerve block for certain procedures, labor analgesia, and daylight surgery.\n\nBy drug, the desflurane segment is estimated to grow significantly during the forecast period. The most recent inhalation drug to enter clinical use is desflurane. Its main benefit is that it recovers more quickly than sevoflurane. Because it produces consistent hemodynamics and respiratory characteristics during use, it seems to be well tolerated as a maintenance anesthetic.\n\nBy application, the maintenance segment was dominant in the inhalation anesthesia market in 2024. The most often used medications for maintenance are inhaled anesthetics. While intravenous anesthetics may be utilized for brief treatments, inhalation anesthetics are the major method used to maintain general anesthesia. Inhalation anesthetics are more common for protracted anesthesia because they may reverse central nerve depression more easily and give faster changes in anesthetic depth than injectable anesthetics. Maintenance medications are necessary for a safe transition between these stages of anesthesia.\n\nBy application, the induction segment is assumed to grow significantly during the forecast period. An essential ability for anesthetists is inhalational induction. It can induce anesthesia in a painless, gradual, and well-tolerated manner; inhalational induction may be required in emergency situations and in non-specialist facilities, where calm control and safety depend on a thorough comprehension of the principles and practice.\n\nBy end-use, the hospitals segment dominated the inhalation anesthesia market in 2024. The need for inhalation anesthesia in hospitals has increased due to the growing number of elective surgeries, minimally invasive treatments, and sophisticated operations, which are being driven by an older population and a larger incidence of chronic illnesses. Hospitals will be encouraged to use improved inhalation anesthetic agents as surgery volumes continue to rise and the demand for safe and efficient anesthetic solutions rises.\n\nBy end-use, the ambulatory surgical centers segment is estimated to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period. ASCs are known for being more affordable than conventional hospital settings. Their decreased operating costs frequently translate into better reimbursement rates for healthcare providers and cheaper out-of-pocket expenditures for patients. The rising use of inhalation anesthesia in ASCs is a result of this economic advantage, which makes these facilities a desirable option for both patients and insurance.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nAbbVie, Inc., Baxter International, Fresenius SE & Co., Halocarbon Products Corporation, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Kent Scientific Corporation, Midmark Corporation, Novartis AG, Nysora, Piramal Pharma Ltd., Sandoz International, Sedana Medical AB, and Vero Biotech.\n\nBrowse More Insights of Towards Healthcare:\n\nAnesthesia Monitoring Devices Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/anesthesia-monitoring-devices-marketAnesthesia Drugs Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/anesthesia-drugs-a-numbing-agent-in-surgeriesGeneric Drugs Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/generic-drugs-marketIron Deficiency Anemia Therapy Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/iron-deficiency-anemia-therapy-market-sizingOver the Counter (OTC) Drugs Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/over-the-counter-otc-drugs-market-sizingAsthma Treatment Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/asthma-treatment-marketNorth America Diabetic Foot Ulcer Treatment Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/north-america-diabetic-foot-ulcer-treatment-market-sizingAcne Treatment Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/acne-treatment-marketBrain Implants Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/brain-implants-marketLung Disease Therapeutics Market Size: https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/lung-disease-therapeutics-market\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn February 2025, Sedana Medical AB (publ) declared that INSPiRE-ICU 2, its second key U.S. study, had achieved its primary goal and, as a result, showed that inhaled sedation with isoflurane was not inferior to intravenous sedation with propofol.In February 2023, Vero Biotech declared that their innovative Genosyl system for the administration of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been approved by the US FDA.
