      "title": "Looking for a Growth Stock? 3 Reasons Why First Business Financial Services (FBIZ) is a Solid Choice",
      "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends First Business Financial Services (FBIZ) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this bank holding company for First Business Bank and First Business Bank-Milwaukee is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for First Business Financial Services is 25.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 4.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 0.5%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for First Business Financial Services is 92.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 22.2%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 19.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 16.7%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for First Business Financial Services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made First Business Financial Services a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that First Business Financial Services is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Valneva SE Sponsored ADR (VALN) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Valneva SE Sponsored ADR is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Valneva SE Sponsored ADR imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 14.2%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Valneva SE Sponsored ADR to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "HSBC vs. NABZY: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?",
      "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Banks - Foreign sector might want to consider either HSBC (HSBC) or National Australia Bank Ltd. (NABZY). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, HSBC has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while National Australia Bank Ltd. has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that HSBC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than NABZY has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nHSBC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.16, while NABZY has a forward P/E of 11.66. We also note that HSBC has a PEG ratio of 0.34. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NABZY currently has a PEG ratio of 0.99.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for HSBC is its P/B ratio of 0.52. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NABZY has a P/B of 1.34.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, HSBC holds a Value grade of B, while NABZY has a Value grade of D.\n\nHSBC stands above NABZY thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HSBC is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\n\nOf these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.\n\nIn addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with \"A\" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.\n\nGreif (GEF) is a stock many investors are watching right now. GEF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 8.57, while its industry has an average P/E of 10.67. Over the past 52 weeks, GEF's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.92 and as low as 8.15, with a median of 9.60.\n\nInvestors will also notice that GEF has a PEG ratio of 0.86. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. GEF's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.21. Over the last 12 months, GEF's PEG has been as high as 1.29 and as low as 0.81, with a median of 0.96.\n\nValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. GEF has a P/S ratio of 0.46. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.88.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors could also keep in mind Graphic Packaging Holding Company (GPK), an Containers - Paper and Packaging stock with a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and Value grade of A.\n\nShares of Graphic Packaging Holding Company are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 8.54 and a PEG ratio of 0.34 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 10.67 and 1.21, respectively.\n\nOver the last 12 months, GPK's P/E has been as high as 17.63, as low as 8.29, with a median of 9.93, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 0.71, as low as 0.33, with a median of 0.40.\n\nFurthermore, Graphic Packaging Holding Company holds a P/B ratio of 3.31 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 7.78. GPK's P/B has been as high as 3.85, as low as 2.95, with a median of 3.31 over the past 12 months.\n\nThese are only a few of the key metrics included in Greif and Graphic Packaging Holding Company strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, GEF and GPK look like an impressive value stock at the moment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it.\n\nThe trend often reverses before exiting the trade, leading to a short-term capital loss for investors. So, for a profitable trade, one should confirm factors such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. that could keep the momentum in the stock alive.\n\nInvestors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.\n\nThere are several stocks that passed through the screen and International Seaways (INSW) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing.\n\nA solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. INSW is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 57.9% over this period.\n\nHowever, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame.

      "title": "3 Top-Ranked Momentum Stocks to Buy Using Driehaus Strategy",
      "content": "The Driehaus strategy can be used to choose the best momentum stocks with the “buy high and sell higher\" theory. No doubt, it’s a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.\n\nTo that end, stocks like Kimbell Royalty KRP, PBF Energy PBF and LPL Financial LPLA have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.\n\nA Detailed Look Into the Driehaus Strategy\n\nRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.\n\nIt is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.\n\nMoreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers.

      "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 12, 2022 – Stocks in this week’s article are Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. TERN, AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. AB and ALLETE, Inc. ALE.\n\n3 Stocks for Higher Returns as New Analysts Initiate Coverage\n\nAs analysts are the key information intermediaries in capital markets, initiation of coverage by them offers critical information on a stock that is of great value to investors.\n\nTerns Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. and ALLETE, Inc. are a few stocks that have witnessed new analyst coverage lately. These, therefore, are expected to attract investor attention.\n\nCoverage initiation by analyst(s) on a stock portrays higher investor inclination. Investors, on their part, often assume there is something special in a stock to attract analysts’ interest. In other words, they believe that the company coming under coverage has value that can’t be ignored.\n\nObviously, stocks are not randomly chosen to cover. New coverage usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst(s). At times, increased investors’ focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it. After all, who doesn’t love to produce something that is already in demand? Hence, we often find that analysts’ ratings on newly-added stocks are more favorable than ratings on continuously covered stocks.\n\nIt is worth mentioning here that the average change in broker recommendation is always preferred over a single recommendation change.\n\nNew Analyst Coverage & Impact on Price Movement\n\nThe price movement of a stock is the function of the recommendations on it from new analysts. Typically, stocks see an upward price movement on new analyst coverage compared to what was witnessed with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage. Positive recommendations — Buy and Strong Buy — generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations. On the contrary, analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, investors start paying more attention to the stock (that has very few or no existing coverage) on which an analyst provides a new recommendation. Also, any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock.\n\nBelow, we have selected three stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks.\n\nHere are three out of the six stocks that passed the screen:\n\nTerns Pharmaceuticals: This is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Foster City, CA. Terns Pharmaceuticals engages in the development of small-molecule single-agent and combination therapy candidates for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and obesity.\n\nTERN stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has gained 122.2% over the past six months against the industry’s 16.2% decline. Loss estimates for 2022 have narrowed to $2.10 per share from $2.18 over the past 30 days. The estimated figure calls for a 5% improvement from the year-ago period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nAllianceBernstein: This is a New York, NY-based publicly owned company that provides diversified investment management services to its clients.\n\nAB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has declined 26.2% over the past six months, underperforming the industry’s 18.1% decline. Nonetheless, earnings estimates for 2022 have increased to $2.97 per share from $2.85 over the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ optimism over the company's prospects.\n\nALLETE: Headquartered in Duluth, MN, ALLETE is an energy company operating through Regulated Operations, ALLETE Clean Energy, and Corporate and Other segments.\n\nALE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The stock has declined 24.3% over the past six months, underperforming the industry’s 21.5% decline. Nonetheless, earnings estimates for 2022 have increased to $3.74 per share from $3.73 over the past 30 days, depicting analysts’ optimism over the company prospects.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

      "title": "Here's Why Investors Should Retain Terex (TEX) Stock Now",
      "content": "Terex Corporation TEX is well-poised for growth on the back of robust customer demand and backlog levels in both its segments. Focus on cost-control actions, strategic growth initiatives, investment in innovative products and digital growth bodes well.\r\n\r\nTEX currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 offer the best investment opportunities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nLet's delve deeper into the factors that make Terex worth holding on to at the moment.\n\nPrice Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock has gained 11% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.6%.\n\nPositive Earnings Surprise Trend\n\nTerex has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 31.7%, on average.\n\nUpbeat Outlook\n\nTerex expects earnings in the range of $3.80-$4.20 in 2022, indicating 30% growth at the midpoint from the year-ago reported figure. Growth will be driven by strong demand, TEX’s efforts to overcome supply disruptions and a ramp-up in production. Price hikes and cost reductions will help offset inflationary pressures and aid earnings.\n\nNorthward Growth Projections\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TEX’s earnings per share is currently pegged at $4.01 for 2022, indicating a 30.6% improvement from the prior-year reported figure. The same for 2023 stands at $4.67, projecting an improvement of 16.5% from the year-ago reported number. TEX has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 17.3%.\n\nSolid Momentum in Segments\n\nTerex’s Aerial Work Platforms segment is witnessing continued solid global demand. It will gain from its efforts to right-size its cost structure, focus on operational execution, a strengthening global footprint and innovative product offerings. In the Material Processing segment, robust end-market demand will drive revenues. A solid product pipeline, expansion into newer geographies, rollout of innovative products and a continued strong execution are positives.\r\n\r\nTerex’s backlog in both its segments improved over the last seven quarters owing to solid demand. TEX ended the recently-reported second-quarter 2022, with a solid total backlog of $3.47 billion, up 51% from last year’s levels. This bodes well for its top-line performance in the forthcoming quarters. Higher spending on infrastructure in the United States is expected to be a major catalyst for TEX going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Key Drivers\n\nTerex made significant progress in its “Execute, Innovate, Grow” strategy. Per the “Execute” theme, TEX continues the advancement made with its “Execute to Win” theme by intensifying process discipline and implementing several new operational processes, among other initiatives. Working on this theme, TEX managed to lower its SG&A expense to 11% of its sales.\r\n\r\nThe “Innovate” factor emphasizes on continuously developing its product offerings and applying technology. In sync with this objective, Terex recently launched the first-of-its-kind all-electric utility truck. The “Grow” aspect focuses on increasing its inorganic investment and acquisitions, the most recent being the transactions of Steelweld and ProAll.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Terex is focused on maintaining strong liquidity. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, TEX had $678.3 million of total available liquidity, with no near-term maturities. Its total debt-to-total capital ratio has gone down over the past few years and came in at 0.44 as of Jun 30, 2022, lower than the industry’s 0.70.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the Industrial Products sector are  Tenaris TS, CECO Environmental CECE and W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW. While TS flaunts a Zacks Rank #1, CECE and GWW carry a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nTenaris delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 34%, on average. Earnings estimates have increased 8% for fiscal 2022 in the past 60 days. TS’ shares have risen 11% in the past three months.\r\n\r\nCECO Environmental delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 29.1%, on average. Earnings estimates have increased 17% for fiscal 2022 in the past 60 days. The CECE stock has gained 61% in the past three months.\r\n\r\nGrainger’s earnings surprise in the last four quarters was 7.9%, on average. In the past 60 days, GWW’s earnings estimates have increased 4% for 2022. The stock has gained 6% in the past three months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nCF Industries (CF) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this fertilizer maker a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for CF is 75.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 355.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 165.4%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for CF is 90.8%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 82.6%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 24% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 22.8%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for CF have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.7% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCF has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions CF well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nReliance Steel (RS) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends.

And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this metals service-center company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Reliance Steel is 32.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 27.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -14%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Reliance Steel has an S/TA ratio of 1.73, which means that the company gets $1.73 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 1.31, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Reliance Steel is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 21.1% this year versus the industry average of 7.8%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Reliance Steel have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Reliance Steel a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Reliance Steel is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Howard Hughes (HHC) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.

That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

      "title": "3 Stocks for Higher Returns as New Analysts Initiate Coverage",
      "content": "As analysts are the key information intermediaries in capital markets, initiation of coverage by them offers critical information on a stock that is of great value to investors.\r\n\r\nTerns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. TERN, AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. AB and ALLETE, Inc. ALE are a few stocks that have witnessed new analyst coverage lately. These, therefore, are expected to attract investor attention.\r\n\r\nCoverage initiation by analyst(s) on a stock portrays higher investor inclination. Investors, on their part, often assume there is something special in a stock to attract analysts’ interest. In other words, they believe that the company coming under coverage has value that can’t be ignored.\r\n\r\nObviously, stocks are not randomly chosen to cover. New coverage usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst(s). At times, increased investors’ focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it. After all, who doesn’t love to produce something that is already in demand? Hence, we often find that analysts’ ratings on newly-added stocks are more favorable than ratings on continuously covered stocks.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning here that the average change in broker recommendation is always preferred over a single recommendation change.\r\n\r\nNew Analyst Coverage & Impact on Price Movement\r\n\r\nThe price movement of a stock is the function of the recommendations on it from new analysts. Typically, stocks see an upward price movement on new analyst coverage compared to what was witnessed with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage. Positive recommendations — Buy and Strong Buy — generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations. On the contrary, analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, investors start paying more attention to the stock (that has very few or no existing coverage) on which an analyst provides a new recommendation. Also, any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock.\r\n\r\nBelow, we have selected three stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nScreening Criteria\n\nNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago (this will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage).\r\n\r\nAverage Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago (“less than” means “better than” four weeks ago).\r\n\r\nIncreased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should also consider other relevant parameters to make it foolproof.\n\nHere are the other screening parameters:\n\nPrice greater than or equal to $5 (as a stock below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors).\r\n\r\nAverage Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100,000 shares (if the volume isn’t enough, it will not attract individual investors).\n\nHere are three out of the six stocks that passed the screen:\n\nTerns Pharmaceuticals: This is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Foster City, CA. Terns Pharmaceuticals engages in the development of small-molecule single-agent and combination therapy candidates for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and obesity.\r\n\r\nTERN stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock has gained 122.2% over the past six months against the industry’s 16.2% decline. Loss estimates for 2022 have narrowed to $2.10 per share from $2.18 over the past 30 days. The estimated figure calls for a 5% improvement from the year-ago period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAllianceBernstein: This is a New York, NY-based publicly owned company that provides diversified investment management services to its clients.\r\n\r\nAB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has declined 26.2% over the past six months, underperforming the industry’s 18.1% decline. Nonetheless, earnings estimates for 2022 have increased to $2.97 per share from $2.85 over the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ optimism over the company prospects.\r\n\r\nALLETE: Headquartered in Duluth, MN, ALLETE is an energy company operating through Regulated Operations, ALLETE Clean Energy, and Corporate and Other segments.\r\n\r\nALE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The stock has declined 24.3% over the past six months, underperforming the industry’s 21.5% decline. Nonetheless, earnings estimates for 2022 have increased to $3.74 per share from $3.73 over the past 30 days, depicting analysts’ optimism over the company prospects.\r\n\r\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

      "title": "MPLX LP (MPLX) Dips More Than Broader Markets: What You Should Know",
      "content": "MPLX LP (MPLX) closed the most recent trading day at $30.73, moving -1.13% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.75% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.32%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.11%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the company had lost 6.39% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 1.45% and was narrower than the S&P 500's loss of 8.4% in that time.\n\nMPLX LP will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 1, 2022. In that report, analysts expect MPLX LP to post earnings of $0.84 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 13.51%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.52 billion, down 1.64% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.28 per share and revenue of $10.56 billion, which would represent changes of +14.69% and +5.32%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MPLX LP. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.41 billion, up 8% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.73 per share and revenue of $5.44 billion. These totals would mark changes of +261.68% and +6.17%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Yellow Corporation. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Yellow Corporation is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Yellow Corporation has a Forward P/E ratio of 2.6 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.87.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Transportation - Services industry is part of the Transportation sector.

      "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this Mexican food chain is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Chipotle is 34.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6.6%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Chipotle is 80.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 18.9%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 42.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.3%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Chipotle have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nChipotle has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Chipotle is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Akouos, Inc. (AKUS) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Akouos, Inc. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Akouos, Inc. rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Akouos, Inc.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2022, this company is expected to earn -$2.55 per share, which is a change of -1.2% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Akouos, Inc. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.7%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Akouos, Inc. to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV has declined 19.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s decrease of 48.3%.\r\n\r\nAlthough the company’s shares have declined in the year, the stock is likely to take a U-turn due to pent-up demand, Ticketmaster growth and strong sponsorship. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s earnings in 2022 and 2023 are estimated to witness growth of 117.2% and 164%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGrowth Drivers\n\nThe company continues to benefit from robust demand. For concerts, the company said that it has already sold more than 100 million tickets for shows in the second half of 2022 and 2023. For the remainder of 2022, confirmed show bookings are up more than 30%, owing to double-digit increases in every market and across all venue types.\r\n\r\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the company is likely to benefit from robust attendance. Live Nation Entertainment believes that several of its artists like Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Garth Brooks, among others, will have multi-year tours across the United States and Europe. This, in turn, will drive the company’s performance.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has acted as a boon for Ticketmaster. Demand for digital ticketing has increased as venues as well as artists are seeking contactless transactions due to the pandemic. Ticketmaster is likely to benefit in 2022 from increased Live Nation concert ticket sales and additional sales from new clients.\r\n\r\nDuring third-quarter 2021, Ticketmaster witnessed its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter, excluding refunds, driven by sports legs resuming and concert on-sales for 2022 ramping up. The company is benefiting from technology investments.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s sponsorships also witnessed the best quarter. During second-quarter 2022, sponsorship revenues were $379.5 million, up from the prior-year quarter’s $67.2 million. During the second quarter of 2022, the company gained from high growth in both on-site and online sponsorship as the United States, the United Kingdom and Mainland Europe are all fully open.\r\n\r\nThe company is likely to benefit from the OCESA buyout. It has a strong business portfolio in ticketing, sponsorship, food & beverage, merchandise, and venue operation. The company has 13 premier venues across Mexico. During its first-quarter 2022 conference call, the company announced that it anticipates OCESA to report full-year results in line with 2019 as Mexico is fully active.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Key Picks\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, Hyatt Hotels Corporation H and InterContinental Hotels Group PLC IHG.\r\n\r\nMarriott Vacations currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. VAC has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.9%, on average. The stock has declined 18% in the past year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for VAC’s current financial year sales and earnings per share (EPS) indicates an increase of 19.7% and 131.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported levels.\r\n\r\nHyatt carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). H has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 798.9%, on average.

      "content": "Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it.\n\nOften, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.\n\nOur \"Recent Price Strength\" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.\n\nThere are several stocks that passed through the screen and WANdisco PLC (WANSF) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing.\n\nA solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. WANSF is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 61.1% over this period.\n\nHowever, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 20.8% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company.\n\nMoreover, WANSF is currently trading at 96.8% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.\n\nLooking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nAnother factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.\n\nSo, the price trend in WANSF may not reverse anytime soon.\n\nIn addition to WANSF, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past. You could easily do that with the help of the Zacks Research Wizard. In addition to allowing you to backtest the effectiveness of your strategy, the program comes loaded with some of our most successful stock-picking strategies.\n\nClick here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Staar Surgical (STAA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of implantable lenses is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Staar Surgical is 42.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 2.6%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Staar Surgical is 61.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 16.5%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 45.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.8%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Staar Surgical. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Staar Surgical a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Staar Surgical is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?",
      "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Helmerich & Payne (HP), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Helmerich & Payne currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if HP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil and gas well-drilling contractor holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor HP, shares are up 4.2% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is up 3.27% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 0.72% compares favorably with the industry's 0.42% performance as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Helmerich & Payne have increased 12.53% over the past quarter, and have gained 41.25% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -2.23% and -12.76%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to HP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. HP is currently averaging 906,915 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HP.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HP's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.08 to -$0.04 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that HP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Helmerich & Payne on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?",
      "content": "Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Vipshop Holdings Limited basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Vipshop Holdings Limited, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10.2%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time.

      "title": "What Makes TravelCenters of America (TA) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
      "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at TravelCenters of America (TA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. TravelCenters of America currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if TA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this truck-stop operator holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor TA, shares are up 1.45% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Convenience Stores industry is up 0.72% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.04% compares favorably with the industry's 0.74% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of TravelCenters of America have risen 61.26%, and are up 3.61% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -2.23% and -12.76%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of TA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, TA is averaging 147,506 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with TA.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost TA's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.56 to $8.08 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that TA is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep TravelCenters of America on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Investors might want to bet on Cross Country Healthcare (CCRN), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cross Country basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Cross Country imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding.

      "content": "Investors interested in Alternative Energy - Other stocks are likely familiar with HF Sinclair (DINO) and Ormat Technologies (ORA). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nHF Sinclair has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Ormat Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that DINO likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ORA has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nDINO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4, while ORA has a forward P/E of 66.95. We also note that DINO has a PEG ratio of 0.35. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ORA currently has a PEG ratio of 6.09.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for DINO is its P/B ratio of 1.30. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ORA has a P/B of 2.44.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, DINO holds a Value grade of A, while ORA has a Value grade of C.\n\nDINO sticks out from ORA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that DINO is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "5 Reasons to Buy Mid-America Apartment (MAA) Stock Right Now",
      "content": "Headquartered in Germantown, TN, Mid-America Apartment Communities MAA — commonly known as MAA — is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) residential REIT have declined 12.7% over the past month, narrower than the industry’s fall of 12.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMAA is experiencing a favorable estimate revision trend. Estimates for the third quarter and current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share have moved north marginally over the past two months. Projected FFO per share growth rates for the third quarter and 2022 are 17.4% and 18.1%, respectively.\n\nFactors That Make Mid-America Apartment a Solid Pick\n\nSunbelt-Focused Portfolio: MAA’s well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. Encouragingly, MAA’s portfolio was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets, as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable trends are increasing the desirability of its markets and boosting demand for rental units. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenue growth.\r\n\r\nExpansion Efforts: This Sunbelt-focused apartment REIT opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. MAA projects development investments of $175 to $225 million and acquisitions of $75 to 125 million for 2022. Such efforts are likely to improve portfolio quality and propel the company’s growth over the long term.\r\n\r\nAmid a competitive pricing environment for acquisitions and the growing demand for apartment housing across its Sunbelt markets, the company’s focus on its development pipeline is a strategic fit.\r\n\r\nRedevelopment & Technology Initiatives: MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations.\r\n\r\nThe programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base. Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion.\r\n\r\nBalance Sheet Strength: MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. It generated 95.1% unencumbered NOI in the second quarter of 2022, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.\r\n\r\nMAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with the 22.97% growth expected for the industry. In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity is 10.01% compared with the industry’s average of 5.52%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers. \r\n\r\nDividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. In May 2022, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.25 per share, marking a 15% hike over the prior payment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in December 2021, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.0875 per share. This marked a 6.1% sequential hike and the 12th consecutive annual increase in the company’s dividend. Looking at the company’s FFO growth projections and its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome key picks from the REIT sector include Equity Residential EQR and BRT Apartments BRT.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equity Residential’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past week to $3.52. EQR carries a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRT Apartments’ 2022 FFO per share has moved 5.8% upward in the past two months to $1.63. BRT presently sports a Zacks Rank of 1.\r\n\r\nNote: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it.\n\nThe trend often reverses before exiting the trade, leading to a short-term capital loss for investors. So, for a profitable trade, one should confirm factors such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. that could keep the momentum in the stock alive.\n\nInvestors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.\n\nVista Oil & Gas, S.A.B. de C.V. Sponsored ADR (VIST) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for \"trend\" investors.\n\nA solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. VIST is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 92.3% over this period.\n\nHowever, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 21.3% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company.\n\nMoreover, VIST is currently trading at 99.2% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.\n\nLooking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nAnother factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.\n\nSo, the price trend in VIST may not reverse anytime soon.\n\nIn addition to VIST, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

      "title": "3 Bank Stocks to Watch",
      "content": "As we head into earnings season investors may want to pay attention to the Financial Sector. Many notable financial players are enjoying favorable estimate revisions.\n\nIt should be said that banks may start receiving a boost from higher interest rates in many of their business segments. Let’s take a look at three banks to keep an eye on.\n\nBank First National BFC\n\nThe first bank on the list to consider is Bank First National (BFC). BFC has many diverse financial accounts including deposits, checking, CDs, money markets, and loan products. Bank First National also offers treasury management services, credit cards, electronic banking services, safe deposit boxes, insurance services, and ATM processing.\n\nHeadquartered in Wisconsin, BFC’s Banks-Northeast Industry is in the top 9% of over 250 Zacks Industries. BFC currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with EPS estimate revisions on the rise. Bank First National’s earnings estimates for the current quarter and next quarter have gone up again. This has also led to positive revisions for the current year and FY23.\n\nBFC’s earnings are expected to rise 9% this year and climb another 19% in FY23 at $7.70 a share, based on Zacks estimates. Top line growth is also expected, with sales set to rise 13% this year and another 25% in FY23 to $160.4 million.\n\nYear to date BFC is up +7% to blast the S&P 500’s -21% and its peer groups -6%. BFC has performed well during this year’s high inflationary environment and the company’s growth is reflected in its price performance over the last five years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom the chart above we can see that BFC has also outperformed the benchmark over the last five years at +54%. This also outperformed its peer group’s -4% drop during this time.\n\nBank First National currently trades around $77 a share, not too far from its highs, which is no easy task in 2022. At current levels, BFC has a forward P/E of 12.1X. This is above the industry average, but the rising EPS estimates are starting to support investors paying up for BFC. Plus, it’s trading below its decade-long highs of 18.7X and the median of 12.9X.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile lower than the industry average, BFC does offer a 1.27% annual dividend yield at $1.00 per share. BFC’s growth rate for this year and FY23 at 19% is higher than its highly-ranked industry. And the average Zacks Price target of $91.00 suggests 16% upside from current levels.\n\nFirst Northwest Bancorp FNWB\n\nWith the Banks-West Industry being in the top 10% out of 251 Zacks Industries investors should keep an eye on First Northwest Bancorp (FNWB). FNWB also sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimate revisions trending higher for FY23.\n\nFirst Northwest Bancorp is the bank holding company for First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Port Angeles. The company offers checking, savings, money market accounts, CDs, and commercial lending products. First Northwest Bancorp also offers electronic banking and online banking services.\n\nWhile earnings are expected to be down -15% in 2022 a rebound in FY23 is expected. FNWB’s FY23 earnings are expected to climb 71% at $2.40 a share from $1.40 in FY22, based on Zacks estimates. Sales are expected to be up 10% this year and another 17% in FY23 to $95.46 million. As First Northwest Bancorp adjusts to the current high inflationary conditions, its earnings appear poised to adjust with its top-line growth.\n\nFNWB is up +27% year to date blasting the benchmark and its peer group’s -8% decline. Plus, over the last two years, FNWB is up +135% vs. the S&P 500’s +11%. This also outpaced its peer group’s +66%. Despite the incredible run, FNWB still looks attractive at current levels.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTrading around $16 a share, FNWB has a forward P/E of 11.3X. This is higher than the industry average of 9.6X. With that being said, FNWB’s FY23 expected growth rate is 71% and trumps its peer group’s 15%. Even better, the stock is trading at a discount to its decade high of 21.5X and the median of 13.7X.\n\nThe average Zacks Price Target of $21 a share still suggests 31% upside from current levels. FNWB’s dividend is lower than the industry average but does offer investors a 1.76% annual yield at $0.28 per share.\n\nSmartFinancial SMBK\n\nAnother bank seeing revisions to the upside before it reports Q3 earnings later this month is SmartFinancial (SMBK). SmartFinancial provides banking services to individuals and corporations through its subsidiaries SmartBank and Cornerstone Community Bank.\n\nSMBK provides deposit products, loan products, and e-banking services consisting of online bill payments, smart pay, mobile banking, and debit and credit cards.\n\nSMBK is also in the top-rated Banks-Northeast Industry. Although the stock is down -8% YTD, it has outperformed the benchmark and roughly matched its peer groups -6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlus, over the last two years, SMBK is up +69% to crush the S&P 500’s +11% and its peer groups +52%. SMBK’s $25 price tag may attract some investors looking for a more affordable option among the Banks-Northeast Industry which is in the top 9%.\n\nSMBK has a forward P/E of 9.6X. This is near the industry average and well below its decade high of 28.1X and median of 12.3X. SMBK’s 27% growth rate over the last five years has also outpaced the industry.\n\nSMBK currently lands a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the average Zacks Price Target offers 25% upside. Although below the industry average,SMBK also offers investors a 1.11% annual dividend yield at $0.28 per share.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings estimate revisions trending higher is a good sign for the Financial sector. This shows banks are starting to adapt to higher interest rates and use them to their advantage. Many regional banks will be beneficiaries and are trading at a discount relative to their past.\n\nNow may be the time for investors to keep an eye out for opportunities among bank stocks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "WSFS Financial (WSFS) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for WSFS basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor WSFS, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

      "title": "United Rentals and FedEx have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
      "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 6, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares United Rentals, Inc. URI as the Bull of the Day and FedEx FDX as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, TotalEnergiesSE TTE and Equinor ASA EQNR.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous Industry is currently ranked in the top 21% of all Zacks Industries (52 out of 251).\n\nAccording to studies, 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its group, making it clear why it’s critical for investors to target stocks in a thriving industry.\n\nA stock in the realm, United Rentals, Inc. sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) paired with an overall VGM Score of an A.\n\nUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of rental locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe.\n\nURI’s customer base includes construction and industrial companies, utilities, municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors and homeowners, and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.\n\nAnalysts have been bullish across the board over the last several months, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nLet’s take a closer look.\n\nShare Performance\n\nYear-to-date, URI shares have been notably defensive, down roughly 11% and widely outperforming the general market. In fact, URI shares have even outperformed the S&P 500 over a much longer five-year timeframe, up a triple-digit 106% vs. the S&P 500’s 66% return. Posting market-beating returns across several timeframes indicates that buyers have consistently been present.\n\nValuation\n\nURI shares are more than reasonably priced, further bolstered by its Style Score of an A for Value.\n\nThe company carries a 9.3X forward earnings multiple, nicely beneath its 10.8X five-year median and reflecting a rock-solid 20% discount relative to its Zacks Industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Estimates\n\nURI’s growth profile is inspiring; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $31.73 for FY22 reflects a sizable 43% Y/Y uptick in earnings.\n\nFurther, the company’s bottom line is projected to tack on an additional 11% of growth in FY23.\n\nAnd look out for URI’s upcoming quarterly print – the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $8.88 suggests earnings growth of 35% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nQuarterly Performance\n\nTo top it off, United Rentals has consistently exceeded quarterly estimates, penciling in eight EPS beats over its last ten quarters. Just in its latest release, URI registered a sizable 20% bottom line beat.\n\nRevenue results paint the same positive story; URI has beat top line estimates in nine of its last ten quarterly prints. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOne of the best ways investors can find expected winners is by utilizing the Zacks Rank – one of the most potent market tools out there that gives investors a massive advantage.\n\nA portfolio consisting of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of 24%.\n\nAdditionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\n\nUnited Rentals, Inc. would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nIn an announcement that shook the market in September, FedEx withdrew its FY23 earnings forecast due to a volatile operating environment.\n\nIt was a major shock, as the original guidance was given just a few months back in June, the same month that long-time CEO Fred Smith vacated his post.\n\nFollowing a multi-year uphill battle with the integration of its TNT Express acquisition, the news further pushed sentiment down.\n\nAnalysts have taken note of the new guidance, slashing their bottom-line outlook across all timeframes with a 100% revision agreement and pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nLet’s take a quick look under the hood.\n\nShare Performance\n\nYear-to-date, FDX shares have undergone adverse price action, down nearly 40% and widely underperforming the general market. Upon viewing a longer five-year timeframe, the share performance paints a similar story; down nearly 24%, FDX shares have widely lagged behind the S&P 500’s 66% gain over the last five years. As briefly mentioned earlier, a so-far unfavorable acquisition of TNT Express in 2016 has weighed heavily on the stock, with the acquisition ending up costing millions more than previously expected.\n\nQuarterly Results\n\nFDX has struggled to exceed bottom line estimates as of late, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in five of its last six quarterly reports. Just in its latest print, FDX missed on the bottom line by nearly 7%.\n\nWhile bottom line results have left much to be desired, the company’s top line appears to be in much better shape – FDX has penciled in nine revenue beats over its last ten quarters.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.\n\nGrowth Estimates\n\nFedEx’s earnings are forecasted to take a sizable hit in its current fiscal year (FY23), with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $15.20 reflecting a steep 26% Y/Y decrease.\n\nStill, things look to kick back into the green for FY24, with estimates calling for 25% Y/Y earnings growth.\n\nFocusing more on the near-term, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $3.12 for its upcoming earnings report suggests a 35% drop off in quarterly earnings from year-ago quarterly EPS of $4.83.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDisheartening bottom line results and recently slashed guidance paint a grim picture for the company in the short term.\n\nFedEx is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), telling us it has a weak near-term earnings outlook.\n\nInstead, investors should pivot to stocks that either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks have a much stronger earnings outlook and potential to deliver explosive gains in the short-term.\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Energy Companies Set to Win the Race to Net-Zero Emissions\n\nAlthough fossil fuels are the prime sources of global energy, economies across the world are steadily transitioning to clean energy. Oil and gas companies continue to progress toward a low-carbon future, as there has been constant pressure to curb climate change.\n\nSeveral companies are readily modifying businesses to incorporate renewables in their operations. This year has been a game-changer as major oil producers convinced investors with their proposals to lower carbon emissions. Although renewable energy can satisfy the global energy demand, it will not eliminate oil and natural gas demand. Hydrocarbon demand will increase at a slower rate.\n\nPer the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable consumption will grow through 2050 at an accelerating pace. Over the same period, the demand for oil and natural gas will grow, but at a slower pace. Renewables are expected to account for  95% of the increase in global power capacity through 2026.\n\nAs the focus on energy transition accelerates, let's look at some of the energy companies outlining net-zero commitments by 2050. Three integrated energy companies are Exxon Mobil Corporation, TotalEnergiesSE and Equinor ASA.\n\nExxonMobil is making efforts to create more-efficient fuels while reducing emissions. XOM plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-50% by 2030 from its upstream business. The aggressive plan will be followed by the reduction in methane intensity and flaring intensity by 70-80% and 60-70%, respectively.\n\nExxonMobil plans to invest more than $15 billion over the next six years on projects associated with reducing emissions. XOM is committed to helping customers reduce emissions by investing in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels.\n\nTotalEnergies aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and is taking the necessary measures to attain the same. TTE plans to expand the clean energy business to reach 35 gigawatts (GW) and 100 GW of gross production capacity from renewable sources by 2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\nTotalEnergies is building a portfolio of low-carbon businesses, which could account for 15-20% of sales by 2040. In the near term, TTE plans to have more than 16 GW of renewable gross capacity in operation by the end of 2022.\n\nEquinor's key strategy is to capitalize on the renewable energy space and align operations with the Paris Climate Agreement. To capitalize on the rising clean energy demand, EQNR is actively investing in renewable energy projects, comprising power generation from solar and wind energy.\n\nEquinor expects to boost production capacities from renewables to 4-6 GW by 2026. By 2035, it plans to boost the capacity to 12-16 GW. In 2021, Equinor recorded capital gains of $1.4 billion from renewables.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nOur 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%.

      "title": "Here's Why \"Trend\" Investors Would Love Betting on Tsingtao Brewery Co. (TSGTY)",
      "content": "When it comes to short-term investing or trading, they say \"the trend is your friend.\" And there's no denying that this is the most profitable strategy. But making sure of the sustainability of a trend to profit from it is easier said than done.\n\nOften, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.\n\nOur \"Recent Price Strength\" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.\n\nThere are several stocks that passed through the screen and Tsingtao Brewery Co. (TSGTY) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing.\n\nA solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. TSGTY is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 3.6% over this period.\n\nHowever, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 12.3% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company.\n\nMoreover, TSGTY is currently trading at 85.2% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.\n\nLooking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nAnother factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy).

      "title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Flowers Foods (FLO)",
      "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Flowers Foods (FLO) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this bakery goods company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Flowers Foods is 9.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 3.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 2%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Flowers Foods has an S/TA ratio of 1.38, which means that the company gets $1.38 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.8, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company.

The company's sales are expected to grow 10.8% this year versus the industry average of 3.9%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

      "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nMid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this real estate investment trust is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 4.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Mid-America Apartment Communities is 39.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 23%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.9%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Mid-America Apartment Communities have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMid-America Apartment Communities has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Mid-America Apartment Communities well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts.

      "content": "Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.\n\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.\n\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\n\nOne company to watch right now is Klabin (KLBAY).

      "title": "Should Value Investors Buy Chico's FAS (CHS) Stock?",
      "content": "The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\n\nOf these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nLuckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.\n\nChico's FAS (CHS) is a stock many investors are watching right now. CHS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.08. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.88. CHS's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.56 and as low as 4.98, with a median of 10.28, all within the past year.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for CHS is its P/B ratio of 1.96. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.39. Over the past 12 months, CHS's P/B has been as high as 4.22 and as low as 1.92, with a median of 2.68.\n\nValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. CHS has a P/S ratio of 0.31. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.39.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, investors should note that CHS has a P/CF ratio of 3.78. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. CHS's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 5.07. CHS's P/CF has been as high as 72.75 and as low as -11.37, with a median of 5.34, all within the past year.\n\nAnother great Retail - Apparel and Shoes stock you could consider is Designer Brands (DBI), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.\n\nDesigner Brands also has a P/B ratio of 2.71 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.39. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 3.40, as low as 2.01, with a median of 2.60.\n\nThese are just a handful of the figures considered in Chico's FAS and Designer Brands's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that CHS and DBI is an impressive value stock right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "When it comes to short-term investing or trading, they say \"the trend is your friend.\" And there's no denying that this is the most profitable strategy. But making sure of the sustainability of a trend to profit from it is easier said than done.\n\nOften, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.\n\nInvestors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.\n\nThere are several stocks that passed through the screen and Lamb Weston (LW) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for \"trend\" investing.\n\nA solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. LW is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 6.3% over this period.\n\nHowever, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 1.1% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this frozen foods supplier.\n\nMoreover, LW is currently trading at 86.8% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.\n\nLooking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

      "title": "Is BHYAX a Strong Bond Fund Right Now?",
      "content": "If you've been stuck searching for Mutual Fund Bond funds, consider BlackRock High Yield Bond A (BHYAX) as a possibility. BHYAX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.\n\nHistory of Fund/Manager\n\nBlackRock is based in New York, NY, and is the manager of BHYAX. The BlackRock High Yield Bond A made its debut in November of 1998 and BHYAX has managed to accumulate roughly $1.16 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.\n\nPerformance\n\nOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 2.3%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 0.61%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.\n\nWhen looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. BHYAX's standard deviation over the past three years is 11.03% compared to the category average of 14.88%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 9.08% compared to the category average of 13.08%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.\n\nThis fund has a beta of 0.39, meaning that it is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, BHYAX has a positive alpha of 2.05, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nExpenses\n\nAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, BHYAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.91% compared to the category average of 0.99%. From a cost perspective, BHYAX is actually cheaper than its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis fund requires a minimum initial investment of $1,000, and each subsequent investment should be at least $50.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOverall, BlackRock High Yield Bond A ( BHYAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.\n\nDon't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Bond funds. We also have plenty more on our site in order to help you find the best possible fund for your portfolio.
