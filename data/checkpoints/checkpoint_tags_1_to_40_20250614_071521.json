      "title": "Can McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC) Maintain Its Strong Returns?",
      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine McCormick & Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for McCormick\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for McCormick is:\n\n15% = US$683m ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.15 in profit.\n\nDoes McCormick Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, McCormick has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Food industry. roe\n\nThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for McCormick.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining McCormick's Debt And Its 15% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by McCormick, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.16. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Pitney Bowes\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pitney Bowes is:\n\n56% = US$52m ÷ US$93m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.56.\n\nDoes Pitney Bowes Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Pitney Bowes has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Commercial Services industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Pitney Bowes by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Pitney Bowes' Debt And Its 56% Return On Equity\n\nIt seems that Pitney Bowes uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 23.95. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "title": "Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EXPD) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong?",
      "content": "With its stock down 10% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Expeditors International of Washington (NASDAQ:EXPD). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Expeditors International of Washington's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Expeditors International of Washington\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Expeditors International of Washington is:\n\n38% = US$1.5b ÷ US$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.38 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nExpeditors International of Washington's Earnings Growth And 38% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Expeditors International of Washington has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 23% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Expeditors International of Washington's considerable five year net income growth of 23% was to be expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Expeditors International of Washington's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 11% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for EXPD? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Expeditors International of Washington Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nExpeditors International of Washington's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 25%, meaning the company retains 75% of its income. So it seems that Expeditors International of Washington is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.\n\nMoreover, Expeditors International of Washington is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. Regardless, Expeditors International of Washington's ROE is speculated to decline to 21% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Expeditors International of Washington's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for Asbury Automotive Group\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Asbury Automotive Group is:\n\n31% = US$677m ÷ US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.31.\n\nDoes Asbury Automotive Group Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Asbury Automotive Group has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Specialty Retail industry (32%). roe\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for Asbury Automotive Group.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nAsbury Automotive Group's Debt And Its 31% ROE\n\nAsbury Automotive Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.80. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

      "title": "Avanos Medical, Inc. (NYSE:AVNS) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future?",
      "content": "Avanos Medical (NYSE:AVNS) has had a rough three months with its share price down 21%. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Avanos Medical's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Avanos Medical\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Avanos Medical is:\n\n1.5% = US$19m ÷ US$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nAvanos Medical's Earnings Growth And 1.5% ROE\n\nAs you can see, Avanos Medical's ROE looks pretty weak. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 10%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Avanos Medical grew its net income at a significant rate of 46% in the last five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Avanos Medical's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 15% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is AVNS worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AVNS is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Avanos Medical Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nAvanos Medical doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, it does look like Avanos Medical has some positive aspects to its business. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:EEFT).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Euronet Worldwide\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Euronet Worldwide is:\n\n7.7% = US$87m ÷ US$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\n\nDoes Euronet Worldwide Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Euronet Worldwide has a lower ROE than the average (17%) in the IT industry classification. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved.  Our risks dashboard should have the 2 risks we have identified for Euronet Worldwide.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Euronet Worldwide's Debt And Its 7.7% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Euronet Worldwide, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.54. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Indivior PLC (LON:INDV).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Indivior\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Indivior is:\n\n72% = US$166m ÷ US$232m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every £1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of £0.72.\n\nDoes Indivior Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Indivior has a better ROE than the average (15%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Indivior's Debt And Its 72% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Indivior, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.04. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Pact Group Holdings Ltd (ASX:PGH).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Pact Group Holdings\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pact Group Holdings is:\n\n4.2% = AU$17m ÷ AU$401m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.04.\n\nDoes Pact Group Holdings Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Pact Group Holdings has a lower ROE than the average (9.6%) in the Packaging industry. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved.  Our risks dashboard should have the 5 risks we have identified for Pact Group Holdings.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Pact Group Holdings' Debt And Its 4.2% Return On Equity\n\nPact Group Holdings does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.70. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Particularly, we will be paying attention to Lynas Rare Earths'  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lynas Rare Earths\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lynas Rare Earths is:\n\n22% = AU$273m ÷ AU$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.22 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.

Especially when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Lynas Rare Earths' significant 52% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Lynas Rare Earths' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 26% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for LYC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Lynas Rare Earths Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nGiven that Lynas Rare Earths doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Lynas Rare Earths' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.

Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nCSL's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE\n\nTo start with, CSL's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for CSL's moderate 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that CSL's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 20% in the same period, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CSL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs CSL Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nCSL has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 44% (or a retention ratio of 56%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\n\nMoreover, CSL is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 40%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 20%.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with CSL's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Conagra Brands\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Conagra Brands is:\n\n12% = US$1.0b ÷ US$8.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.\n\nDoes Conagra Brands Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Conagra Brands has a similar ROE to the average in the Food industry classification (11%). roe\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Conagra Brands by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Conagra Brands' Debt And Its 12% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Conagra Brands, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.03. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Sonic Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:SAH).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Sonic Automotive\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sonic Automotive is:\n\n35% = US$393m ÷ US$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35.\n\nDoes Sonic Automotive Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Sonic Automotive has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Specialty Retail industry average (32%). roe\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Sonic Automotive visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nSonic Automotive's Debt And Its 35% ROE\n\nSonic Automotive does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.42. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of SP Plus Corporation (NASDAQ:SP).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nView our latest analysis for SP Plus\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for SP Plus is:\n\n18% = US$43m ÷ US$235m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.\n\nDoes SP Plus Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, SP Plus has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Commercial Services industry. roe\n\nThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nSP Plus' Debt And Its 18% ROE\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by SP Plus, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.23. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

      "content": "With its stock down 23% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Gorman-Rupp (NYSE:GRC). To decide if this trend could continue, we decided to look at its weak fundamentals as they shape the long-term market trends. In this article, we decided to focus on Gorman-Rupp's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Gorman-Rupp\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Gorman-Rupp is:\n\n9.0% = US$30m ÷ US$333m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nGorman-Rupp's Earnings Growth And 9.0% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Gorman-Rupp's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Therefore, Gorman-Rupp's flat earnings over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.\n\nWe then compared Gorman-Rupp's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 8.8% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Gorman-Rupp fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Gorman-Rupp Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nWith a high three-year median payout ratio of 54% (implying that the company keeps only 46% of its income) of its business to reinvest into its business), most of Gorman-Rupp's profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the absence of growth in earnings.\n\nAdditionally, Gorman-Rupp has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Gorman-Rupp. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

      "content": "PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR) has had a rough three months with its share price down 6.9%. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on PACCAR's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for PACCAR\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PACCAR is:\n\n16% = US$2.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nPACCAR's Earnings Growth And 16% ROE\n\nTo start with, PACCAR's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 12%. Despite this, PACCAR's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that PACCAR's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 8.8% in the same period, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PCAR? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs PACCAR Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nDespite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 25% (implying that the company keeps 75% of its income) over the last three years, PACCAR has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nMoreover, PACCAR has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 46% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like PACCAR has some positive aspects to its business. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

      "title": "Read This Before Judging Hasbro, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HAS) ROE",
      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Hasbro\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hasbro is:\n\n12% = US$381m ÷ US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.\n\nDoes Hasbro Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Hasbro has a lower ROE than the average (29%) in the Leisure industry classification. roe\n\nThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Hasbro visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nHasbro's Debt And Its 12% ROE\n\nHasbro clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.29. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: Hasbro may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

      "title": "Is Ebix, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EBIX) Stock Price Struggling As A Result Of Its Mixed Financials?",
      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Ebix's (NASDAQ:EBIX) recent performance, when its stock has declined 51% over the past three months. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. In this article, we decided to focus on Ebix's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Ebix\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ebix is:\n\n9.1% = US$64m ÷ US$705m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nEbix's Earnings Growth And 9.1% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Ebix's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Ebix's five year net income decline of 6.5% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Ebix's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 25% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Ebix fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Ebix Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nEbix's low three-year median payout ratio of 10% (or a retention ratio of 90%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nMoreover, Ebix has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Ebix. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Unilever PLC (LON:ULVR).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Unilever\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Unilever is:\n\n34% = €6.6b ÷ €20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every £1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn £0.34 in profit.\n\nDoes Unilever Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Unilever has a higher ROE than the average (9.3%) in the Personal Products industry. roe\n\nThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Unilever by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Unilever's Debt And Its 34% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Unilever, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.44. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: Unilever may not be the best stock to buy.

      "content": "Rio Tinto Group (LON:RIO) has had a rough three months with its share price down 14%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Rio Tinto Group's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Rio Tinto Group\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Rio Tinto Group is:\n\n40% = US$23b ÷ US$57b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every £1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn £0.40 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nRio Tinto Group's Earnings Growth And 40% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Rio Tinto Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Rio Tinto Group was able to see a decent net income growth of 19% over the last five years.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between Rio Tinto Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 19% in the same period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is RIO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether RIO is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Rio Tinto Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nThe high three-year median payout ratio of 60% (or a retention ratio of 40%) for Rio Tinto Group suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.\n\nAdditionally, Rio Tinto Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 66%. Regardless, Rio Tinto Group's ROE is speculated to decline to 18% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Rio Tinto Group's performance has been quite good. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Largo's (TSE:LGO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 38% over the past three months. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. In this article, we decided to focus on Largo's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Largo\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Largo is:\n\n5.7% = US$16m ÷ US$292m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every CA$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of CA$0.06.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nLargo's Earnings Growth And 5.7% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Largo's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 11% either. For this reason, Largo's five year net income decline of 8.2% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Largo's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 28% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Largo is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs Largo Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nLargo doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Largo. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Wrapping up, we would proceed with caution with this company and one way of doing that would be to look at the risk profile of the business.

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Unitil Corporation (NYSE:UTL).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Unitil\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Unitil is:\n\n8.3% = US$39m ÷ US$465m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.\n\nDoes Unitil Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Unitil has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Integrated Utilities industry average (9.2%). roe\n\nThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Unitil.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Unitil's Debt And Its 8.3% Return On Equity\n\nUnitil does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.22. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "title": "A Closer Look At RadNet, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:RDNT) Uninspiring ROE",
      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand RadNet, Inc. (NASDAQ:RDNT).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for RadNet\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for RadNet is:\n\n9.2% = US$39m ÷ US$421m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.\n\nDoes RadNet Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, RadNet has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the Healthcare industry classification. roe\n\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for RadNet by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nRadNet's Debt And Its 9.2% ROE\n\nRadNet does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.78. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: RadNet may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

      "title": "Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (LON:BMY) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?",
      "content": "Bloomsbury Publishing (LON:BMY) has had a rough month with its share price down 6.2%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Bloomsbury Publishing's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Bloomsbury Publishing\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Bloomsbury Publishing is:\n\n10.0% = UK£17m ÷ UK£169m (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every £1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn £0.10 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nBloomsbury Publishing's Earnings Growth And 10.0% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Bloomsbury Publishing seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.9%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 18% seen over the past five years by Bloomsbury Publishing.\n\nWhen you consider the fact that the industry earnings have shrunk at a rate of 14% in the same period, the company's net income growth is pretty remarkable.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is BMY worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether BMY is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Bloomsbury Publishing Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nWith a three-year median payout ratio of 43% (implying that the company retains 57% of its profits), it seems that Bloomsbury Publishing is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.\n\nBesides, Bloomsbury Publishing has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 47%. As a result, Bloomsbury Publishing's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 12% for future ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Bloomsbury Publishing's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

      "content": "Frontier Developments (LON:FDEV) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 19% over the last month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Frontier Developments'  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Frontier Developments\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Frontier Developments is:\n\n12% = UK£14m ÷ UK£113m (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each £1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made £0.12 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Frontier Developments' Earnings Growth And 12% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Frontier Developments seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 23% seen over the past five years by Frontier Developments. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing Frontier Developments' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 23% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Frontier Developments fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Frontier Developments Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nFrontier Developments doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Frontier Developments' performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at MAAS Group Holdings' (ASX:MGH) recent performance, when its stock has declined 20% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study MAAS Group Holdings'  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for MAAS Group Holdings\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for MAAS Group Holdings is:\n\n9.4% = AU$38m ÷ AU$399m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.09 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of MAAS Group Holdings' Earnings Growth And 9.4% ROE\n\nAt first glance, MAAS Group Holdings' ROE doesn't look very promising. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Looking at MAAS Group Holdings' exceptional 35% five-year net income growth in particular, we are definitely impressed. Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that MAAS Group Holdings' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 15% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs MAAS Group Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nMAAS Group Holdings' three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 31%, meaning the company retains 69% of its income. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like MAAS Group Holdings is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\n\nWhile MAAS Group Holdings has seen growth in its earnings, it only recently started to pay a dividend. It is most likely that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 29%. However, MAAS Group Holdings' ROE is predicted to rise to 22% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that MAAS Group Holdings has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

      "content": "Metcash's (ASX:MTS) stock is up by a considerable 9.7% over the past week. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Metcash's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Metcash\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Metcash is:\n\n23% = AU$247m ÷ AU$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.23 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nMetcash's Earnings Growth And 23% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Metcash has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 23%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 29% net income growth seen by Metcash was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Metcash's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 0.8%.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MTS? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Metcash Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nMetcash has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 67%, meaning the company only retains 33% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.\n\nMoreover, Metcash is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 70%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Metcash's future ROE will be 21% which is again, similar to the current ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Metcash's performance has been quite good. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad.

      "content": "With its stock down 19% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Michael Hill International (ASX:MHJ). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study Michael Hill International's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Michael Hill International\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Michael Hill International is:\n\n23% = AU$45m ÷ AU$198m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.23 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nMichael Hill International's Earnings Growth And 23% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Michael Hill International has a significantly high ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 21% the company's ROE is pretty decent. However, When you compare Michael Hill International's high ROE with its rather flat earnings, you are left wondering, what's causing the growth to lag? We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Michael Hill International's net income growth with the industry and discovered that the industry saw an average growth of 18% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Michael Hill International is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs Michael Hill International Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nMichael Hill International has a high three-year median payout ratio of 58% (or a retention ratio of 42%), meaning that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This does go some way in explaining why there's been no growth in its earnings.\n\nIn addition, Michael Hill International has been paying dividends over a period of six years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 57% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Michael Hill International's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 25% for future ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like Michael Hill International has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

      "title": "Are Poor Financial Prospects Dragging Down Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT Stock?",
      "content": "Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) has had a rough three months with its share price down 18%. We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Medtronic's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Medtronic\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:\n\n9.6% = US$5.1b ÷ US$53b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nMedtronic's Earnings Growth And 9.6% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Medtronic's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 10%. Having said that, Medtronic has shown a meagre net income growth of 3.6% over the past five years. Remember, the company's ROE is not particularly great to begin with. Hence, this does provide some context to low earnings growth seen by the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Medtronic's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 15% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MDT? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Medtronic Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nThe high three-year median payout ratio of 67% (that is, the company retains only 33% of its income) over the past three years for Medtronic suggests that the company's earnings growth was lower as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.\n\nIn addition, Medtronic has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 16% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Medtronic. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. (NYSE:ELS).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for Equity LifeStyle Properties\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Equity LifeStyle Properties is:\n\n19% = US$294m ÷ US$1.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.19 in profit.\n\nDoes Equity LifeStyle Properties Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Equity LifeStyle Properties has a superior ROE than the average (6.5%) in the REITs industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Equity LifeStyle Properties by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nEquity LifeStyle Properties' Debt And Its 19% ROE\n\nEquity LifeStyle Properties does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.07. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at High Liner Foods' (TSE:HLF) recent performance, when its stock has declined 11% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to High Liner Foods'  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for High Liner Foods\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for High Liner Foods is:\n\n11% = US$39m ÷ US$351m (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every CA$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn CA$0.11 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of High Liner Foods' Earnings Growth And 11% ROE\n\nAt first glance, High Liner Foods seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 8.4% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for High Liner Foods' moderate 6.7% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared High Liner Foods' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 4.5% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether HLF is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs High Liner Foods Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nHigh Liner Foods has a three-year median payout ratio of 26%, which implies that it retains the remaining 74% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\n\nMoreover, High Liner Foods is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with High Liner Foods' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Lamar Advertising Company (NASDAQ:LAMR), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lamar Advertising\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lamar Advertising is:\n\n36% = US$442m ÷ US$1.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.36 in profit.\n\nDoes Lamar Advertising Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Lamar Advertising has a higher ROE than the average (6.5%) in the REITs industry. roe\n\nThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Lamar Advertising.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Lamar Advertising's Debt And Its 36% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Lamar Advertising, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.56. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: Lamar Advertising may not be the best stock to buy.

      "title": "El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOCO) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future?",
      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at El Pollo Loco Holdings' (NASDAQ:LOCO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 12% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study El Pollo Loco Holdings'  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for El Pollo Loco Holdings\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for El Pollo Loco Holdings is:\n\n8.6% = US$27m ÷ US$316m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of El Pollo Loco Holdings' Earnings Growth And 8.6% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, El Pollo Loco Holdings' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 19% either. In spite of this, El Pollo Loco Holdings was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 28% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that El Pollo Loco Holdings' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 2.9% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about El Pollo Loco Holdings''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs El Pollo Loco Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nEl Pollo Loco Holdings doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we feel that El Pollo Loco Holdings certainly does have some positive factors to consider. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Stewart Information Services' (NYSE:STC) recent performance, when its stock has declined 22% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Stewart Information Services'  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Stewart Information Services\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stewart Information Services is:\n\n26% = US$345m ÷ US$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.26 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nStewart Information Services' Earnings Growth And 26% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Stewart Information Services has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 45% net income growth seen by Stewart Information Services over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Stewart Information Services' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for STC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Stewart Information Services Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nThe three-year median payout ratio for Stewart Information Services is 27%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 73%. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Stewart Information Services is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, Stewart Information Services has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Stewart Information Services' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

      "content": "Quanex Building Products (NYSE:NX) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 12% over the last month. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Quanex Building Products'  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nView our latest analysis for Quanex Building Products\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Quanex Building Products is:\n\n17% = US$72m ÷ US$436m (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.17 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Quanex Building Products' Earnings Growth And 17% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Quanex Building Products seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 18%. This probably goes some way in explaining Quanex Building Products' significant 29% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Quanex Building Products' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 13%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is NX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Quanex Building Products Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nQuanex Building Products has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 15%, meaning that it has the remaining 85% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Quanex Building Products is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.\n\nBesides, Quanex Building Products has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Quanex Building Products' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Orion Engineered Carbons S.A. (NYSE:OEC), by way of a worked example.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Orion Engineered Carbons\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Orion Engineered Carbons is:\n\n38% = US$144m ÷ US$377m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.38 in profit.\n\nDoes Orion Engineered Carbons Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Orion Engineered Carbons has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Chemicals industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Orion Engineered Carbons.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Orion Engineered Carbons' Debt And Its 38% Return On Equity\n\nOrion Engineered Carbons does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.20. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Sourcebio International Plc (LON:SBI).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Sourcebio International\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sourcebio International is:\n\n35% = UK£17m ÷ UK£48m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated £0.35 in profit.\n\nDoes Sourcebio International Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Sourcebio International has a higher ROE than the average (10.0%) in the Healthcare industry. roe\n\nThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nSourcebio International's Debt And Its 35% ROE\n\nOne positive for shareholders is that Sourcebio International does not have any net debt! Its high ROE indicates the business is high quality, but the fact that this was achieved without leverage is veritably impressive. After all, with cash on the balance sheet, a company has a lot more optionality in good times and bad.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated £0.01 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of CentralNic Group's Earnings Growth And 1.1% ROE\n\nIt is quite clear that CentralNic Group's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 9.2%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 31% seen by CentralNic Group over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared CentralNic Group's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 25% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if CentralNic Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs CentralNic Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nBecause CentralNic Group doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about CentralNic Group's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "title": "Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Quartix Technologies Plc (LON:QTX)?",
      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Quartix Technologies' (LON:QTX) recent performance, when its stock has declined 16% over the past three months. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Quartix Technologies'  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Quartix Technologies\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Quartix Technologies is:\n\n27% = UK£4.9m ÷ UK£18m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated £0.27 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nQuartix Technologies' Earnings Growth And 27% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Quartix Technologies has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 8.7% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Quartix Technologies' net income shrunk at a rate of 8.6% over the past five years. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, when we compared Quartix Technologies' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 15% in the same period. This is quite worrisome. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for QTX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Quartix Technologies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nIn spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 42% (that is, a retention ratio of 58%), the fact that Quartix Technologies' earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nMoreover, Quartix Technologies has been paying dividends for seven years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 89% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that Quartix Technologies has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Warrior Met Coal's (NYSE:HCC) recent performance, when its stock has declined 16% over the past three months. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Warrior Met Coal's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Warrior Met Coal\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Warrior Met Coal is:\n\n31% = US$318m ÷ US$1.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.31 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nWarrior Met Coal's Earnings Growth And 31% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Warrior Met Coal has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 22% which is quite remarkable. As you might expect, the 27% net income decline reported by Warrior Met Coal doesn't bode well with us. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, as a next step, we compared Warrior Met Coal's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 23% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Warrior Met Coal fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Warrior Met Coal Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nWhen we piece together Warrior Met Coal's low three-year median payout ratio of 1.7% (where it is retaining 98% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nAdditionally, Warrior Met Coal has paid dividends over a period of five years, which means that the company's management is rather focused on keeping up its dividend payments, regardless of the shrinking earnings. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 4.9% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 12% over the same period.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we feel that Warrior Met Coal certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Moreover, after studying current analyst estimates, we discovered that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink in the future.

      "title": "Should We Be Delighted With Britvic plc's (LON:BVIC) ROE Of 26%?",
      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Britvic plc (LON:BVIC).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Britvic\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Britvic is:\n\n26% = UK£118m ÷ UK£451m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each £1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made £0.26 in profit.\n\nDoes Britvic Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Britvic has a better ROE than the average (14%) in the Beverage industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Britvic by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Britvic's Debt And Its 26% Return On Equity\n\nBritvic does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.29. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Britvic may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

      "title": "Is RHI Magnesita N.V.'s (LON:RHIM) 30% ROE Better Than Average?",
      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand RHI Magnesita N.V. (LON:RHIM).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for RHI Magnesita\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for RHI Magnesita is:\n\n30% = €250m ÷ €822m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every £1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of £0.30.\n\nDoes RHI Magnesita Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, RHI Magnesita has a superior ROE than the average (13%) in the Basic Materials industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for RHI Magnesita.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nRHI Magnesita's Debt And Its 30% ROE\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by RHI Magnesita, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.88. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "title": "Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Immatics N.V.'s (NASDAQ:IMTX) Stock Up Recently?",
      "content": "Immatics' (NASDAQ:IMTX) stock is up by a considerable 20% over the past month. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Immatics'  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Immatics\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Immatics is:\n\n13% = €15m ÷ €116m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Immatics' Earnings Growth And 13% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Immatics seems to have a decent ROE. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 21%. Needless to say, the 21% net income shrink rate seen by Immaticsover the past five years is a huge dampener. Bear in mind, the company does have a high ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So there might be other reasons for the earnings to shrink. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Immatics' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 31% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Immatics fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Immatics Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nImmatics doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like Immatics has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a respectable rate of return and is reinvesting a huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

      "content": "Vicor's (NASDAQ:VICR) stock is up by a considerable 9.6% over the past week. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Vicor's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Vicor\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vicor is:\n\n11% = US$47m ÷ US$432m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Vicor's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Vicor seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 44% seen over the past five years by Vicor. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Vicor's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 15%. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Vicor is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs Vicor Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nVicor doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Vicor's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.

      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of AdaptHealth Corp. (NASDAQ:AHCO).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for AdaptHealth\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for AdaptHealth is:\n\n9.6% = US$204m ÷ US$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.\n\nDoes AdaptHealth Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, AdaptHealth has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the Healthcare industry classification. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for AdaptHealth by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdaptHealth's Debt And Its 9.6% ROE\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by AdaptHealth, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.04. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Casey's General Stores'  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Casey's General Stores\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Casey's General Stores is:\n\n15% = US$340m ÷ US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nCasey's General Stores' Earnings Growth And 15% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Casey's General Stores seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Probably as a result of this, Casey's General Stores was able to see a decent growth of 8.2% over the last five years.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between Casey's General Stores' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 7.8% in the same period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Casey's General Stores Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nIn Casey's General Stores' case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 16% (or a retention ratio of 84%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.\n\nMoreover, Casey's General Stores is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 17%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 13%.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Casey's General Stores' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Huntington Ingalls Industries\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Huntington Ingalls Industries is:\n\n19% = US$536m ÷ US$2.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.\n\nDoes Huntington Ingalls Industries Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Huntington Ingalls Industries has a higher ROE than the average (10%) in the Aerospace & Defense industry. roe\n\nThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Huntington Ingalls Industries.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Huntington Ingalls Industries' Debt And Its 19% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Huntington Ingalls Industries, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.13. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "With its stock down 17% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Manulife Financial (TSE:MFC). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Manulife Financial's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Manulife Financial\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Manulife Financial is:\n\n16% = CA$8.9b ÷ CA$57b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every CA$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn CA$0.16 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nManulife Financial's Earnings Growth And 16% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Manulife Financial seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Probably as a result of this, Manulife Financial was able to see an impressive net income growth of 21% over the last five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then performed a comparison between Manulife Financial's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 18% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Manulife Financial's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Manulife Financial Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nThe three-year median payout ratio for Manulife Financial is 36%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 64%. So it seems that Manulife Financial is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.\n\nAdditionally, Manulife Financial has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Manulife Financial's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

      "content": "CGI's (TSE:GIB.A) stock is up by a considerable 5.5% over the past week. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study CGI's  ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for CGI\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CGI is:\n\n21% = CA$1.4b ÷ CA$6.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every CA$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn CA$0.21 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nCGI's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nTo start with, CGI's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 16%. Probably as a result of this, CGI was able to see a decent growth of 5.1% over the last five years.\n\nWe then compared CGI's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 49% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is GIB.A fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs CGI Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nCGI doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with CGI's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Steelcase's (NYSE:SCS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 9.5% over the past month. We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Steelcase's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Steelcase\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Steelcase is:\n\n2.5% = US$21m ÷ US$814m (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.03 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nSteelcase's Earnings Growth And 2.5% ROE\n\nAs you can see, Steelcase's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 11%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 22% seen by Steelcase over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Steelcase's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 7.0% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Steelcase visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nAdditionally, Steelcase has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth.

Particularly, its ROE is a huge disappointment, not to mention its lack of proper reinvestment into the business. As a result its earnings growth has also been quite disappointing.

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (NYSE:HBB).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for Hamilton Beach Brands Holding\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hamilton Beach Brands Holding is:\n\n23% = US$26m ÷ US$113m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.23 in profit.\n\nDoes Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Hamilton Beach Brands Holding has a similar ROE to the average in the Consumer Durables industry classification (21%). roe\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Hamilton Beach Brands Holding visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nHamilton Beach Brands Holding's Debt And Its 23% ROE\n\nHamilton Beach Brands Holding clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.05. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of R1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for R1 RCM\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for R1 RCM is:\n\n28% = US$101m ÷ US$367m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.28.\n\nDoes R1 RCM Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, R1 RCM has a superior ROE than the average (16%) in the Healthcare industry. roe\n\nThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for R1 RCM by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nR1 RCM's Debt And Its 28% ROE\n\nR1 RCM clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.10. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this  free list of interesting companies.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

      "title": "Akamai Technologies, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AKAM) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?",
      "content": "Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) has had a rough three months with its share price down 22%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Akamai Technologies'  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Akamai Technologies is:\n\n14% = US$615m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAkamai Technologies' Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Akamai Technologies seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 17%. This probably goes some way in explaining Akamai Technologies' significant 22% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Akamai Technologies' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 15% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is AKAM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AKAM is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Akamai Technologies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nGiven that Akamai Technologies doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Akamai Technologies' performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

      "content": "Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY) has had a rough three months with its share price down 8.1%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Jack Henry & Associates'  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Jack Henry & Associates\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Jack Henry & Associates is:\n\n27% = US$359m ÷ US$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.27.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nJack Henry & Associates' Earnings Growth And 27% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Jack Henry & Associates has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 17% which is quite remarkable. Yet, Jack Henry & Associates has posted measly growth of 2.2% over the past five years. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Jack Henry & Associates' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Jack Henry & Associates''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Jack Henry & Associates Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nDespite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 43% (implying that the company retains the remaining 57% of its income), Jack Henry & Associates' earnings growth was quite low. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nMoreover, Jack Henry & Associates has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 35% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Jack Henry & Associates' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 28% for future ROE.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, it does look like Jack Henry & Associates has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Computer Modelling Group's (TSE:CMG) recent performance, when its stock has declined 12% over the past three months. It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. In this article, we decided to focus on Computer Modelling Group's  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Computer Modelling Group\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Computer Modelling Group is:\n\n39% = CA$18m ÷ CA$47m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every CA$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn CA$0.39 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Computer Modelling Group's Earnings Growth And 39% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Computer Modelling Group has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. For this reason, Computer Modelling Group's five year net income decline of 2.6% raises the question as to why the high ROE didn't translate into earnings growth. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Computer Modelling Group's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 8.6% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is CMG worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CMG is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Computer Modelling Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nComputer Modelling Group's very high three-year median payout ratio of 108% over the last three years suggests that the company is paying its shareholders more than what it is earning and this explains the company's shrinking earnings. Its usually very hard to sustain dividend payments that are higher than reported profits. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Computer Modelling Group visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nAdditionally, Computer Modelling Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 92%. As a result, Computer Modelling Group's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 37% for future ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Computer Modelling Group. Despite the high ROE, the company has a disappointing earnings growth number, due to its poor rate of reinvestment into its business. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE:JKS).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for JinkoSolar Holding\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for JinkoSolar Holding is:\n\n3.2% = CN¥790m ÷ CN¥24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.\n\nDoes JinkoSolar Holding Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, JinkoSolar Holding has a lower ROE than the average (19%) in the Semiconductor industry classification. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. To know the 3 risks we have identified for JinkoSolar Holding visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining JinkoSolar Holding's Debt And Its 3.2% Return On Equity\n\nJinkoSolar Holding does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.86. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Boralex Inc. (TSE:BLX).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Boralex\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Boralex is:\n\n3.2% = CA$43m ÷ CA$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every CA$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated CA$0.03 in profit.\n\nDoes Boralex Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Boralex has a lower ROE than the average (6.4%) in the Renewable Energy industry classification. roe\n\nUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Boralex by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoralex's Debt And Its 3.2% ROE\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Boralex, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.65. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Boralex may not be the best stock to buy.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Owens & Minor, Inc. (NYSE:OMI).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Owens & Minor\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Owens & Minor is:\n\n20% = US$191m ÷ US$948m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.\n\nDoes Owens & Minor Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Owens & Minor has a better ROE than the average (16%) in the Healthcare industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Owens & Minor.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Owens & Minor's Debt And Its 20% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Owens & Minor, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.78. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for DTE Energy\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for DTE Energy is:\n\n9.7% = US$863m ÷ US$8.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit.\n\nDoes DTE Energy Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. The image below shows that DTE Energy has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Integrated Utilities industry average (9.2%). roe\n\nThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 5 risks we have identified for DTE Energy visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining DTE Energy's Debt And Its 9.7% Return On Equity\n\nDTE Energy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.09. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Edison International (NYSE:EIX), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Edison International\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Edison International is:\n\n3.3% = US$584m ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.\n\nDoes Edison International Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Edison International has a lower ROE than the average (9.2%) in the Electric Utilities industry classification. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Edison International visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nEdison International's Debt And Its 3.3% ROE\n\nEdison International does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.60. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: Edison International may not be the best stock to buy.

      "content": "With its stock down 13% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Montauk Renewables (NASDAQ:MNTK). It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. In this article, we decided to focus on Montauk Renewables'  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for Montauk Renewables\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Montauk Renewables is:\n\n4.7% = US$8.6m ÷ US$183m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.05.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nMontauk Renewables' Earnings Growth And 4.7% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Montauk Renewables' ROE doesn't look that attractive. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 4.7%. But then again, Montauk Renewables' five year net income shrunk at a rate of 85%. Bear in mind, the company does have a slightly low ROE. Therefore, the decline in earnings could also be the result of this.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, even when compared to the industry, which has been shrinking its earnings at a rate 4.6% in the same period, we found that Montauk Renewables' performance is pretty disappointing, as it suggests that the company has been shrunk its earnings at a rate faster than the industry. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Montauk Renewables fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Montauk Renewables Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nBecause Montauk Renewables doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Montauk Renewables. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at ICF International's (NASDAQ:ICFI) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.7% over the past week. It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. In this article, we decided to focus on ICF International's  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ICF International\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ICF International is:\n\n8.8% = US$71m ÷ US$803m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of ICF International's Earnings Growth And 8.8% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, ICF International's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 17% either. As a result, ICF International reported a very low income growth of 4.8% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared ICF International's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 16% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ICFI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs ICF International Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nICF International's low three-year median payout ratio of 16% (or a retention ratio of 84%) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth. This should be reflected in its earnings growth number, but that's not the case. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nAdditionally, ICF International has paid dividends over a period of four years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 12% over the next three years.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about ICF International. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

      "content": "Pangaea Logistics Solutions (NASDAQ:PANL) has had a rough month with its share price down 9.1%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Pangaea Logistics Solutions'  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Pangaea Logistics Solutions\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pangaea Logistics Solutions is:\n\n28% = US$88m ÷ US$316m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.28 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nPangaea Logistics Solutions' Earnings Growth And 28% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Pangaea Logistics Solutions has a significantly high ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 29% the company's ROE is pretty decent. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 46% net income growth seen by Pangaea Logistics Solutions was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Pangaea Logistics Solutions' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 68% in the same period, which is a bit concerning. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PANL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Pangaea Logistics Solutions Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nPangaea Logistics Solutions has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 9.7%, meaning that it has the remaining 90% left over to reinvest into its business.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Federal Realty Investment Trust\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Federal Realty Investment Trust is:\n\n9.4% = US$274m ÷ US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.\n\nDoes Federal Realty Investment Trust Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Federal Realty Investment Trust has a superior ROE than the average (6.5%) in the REITs industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Federal Realty Investment Trust by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Realty Investment Trust's Debt And Its 9.4% ROE\n\nFederal Realty Investment Trust does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.38. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Wabash National Corporation (NYSE:WNC), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for Wabash National\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Wabash National is:\n\n2.9% = US$10m ÷ US$342m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.\n\nDoes Wabash National Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Wabash National has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Machinery industry. roe\n\nThat certainly isn't ideal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high.  Our risks dashboard should have the 4 risks we have identified for Wabash National.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nWabash National's Debt And Its 2.9% ROE\n\nWabash National does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.42. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Wabash National may not be the best stock to buy.

We'll use ROE to examine Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Whirlpool\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Whirlpool is:\n\n35% = US$1.7b ÷ US$4.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.35 in profit.\n\nDoes Whirlpool Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Whirlpool has a better ROE than the average (21%) in the Consumer Durables industry. roe\n\nThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Whirlpool visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Whirlpool's Debt And Its 35% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Whirlpool, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.09. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CNP), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for CenterPoint Energy\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CenterPoint Energy is:\n\n9.2% = US$919m ÷ US$10.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.\n\nDoes CenterPoint Energy Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that CenterPoint Energy has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Integrated Utilities industry average (9.2%). roe\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.

Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this.

      "content": "EML Payments (ASX:EML) has had a rough three months with its share price down 50%. It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Particularly, we will be paying attention to EML Payments'  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for EML Payments\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for EML Payments is:\n\n2.4% = AU$11m ÷ AU$443m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.02 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nEML Payments' Earnings Growth And 2.4% ROE\n\nIt is hard to argue that EML Payments' ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 9.4%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 51% seen by EML Payments over the last five years is not surprising. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared EML Payments' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 4.3% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is EML worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether EML is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs EML Payments Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nBecause EML Payments doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about EML Payments' performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nEvolve Education Group's Earnings Growth And 0.6% ROE\n\nIt is hard to argue that Evolve Education Group's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 5.0%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 27% seen by Evolve Education Group was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Evolve Education Group's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 7.2% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Evolve Education Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Evolve Education Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nEvolve Education Group doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Evolve Education Group. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Northrop Grumman's (NYSE:NOC) recent performance, when its stock has declined 3.6% over the past week. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Northrop Grumman's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Northrop Grumman is:\n\n43% = US$5.8b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.43.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nNorthrop Grumman's Earnings Growth And 43% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Northrop Grumman has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Northrop Grumman over the past five years. growth\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Northrop Grumman's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.9% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.

The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether NOC is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Northrop Grumman Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nWith a three-year median payout ratio of 25% (implying that the company retains 75% of its profits), it seems that Northrop Grumman is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.\n\nAdditionally, Northrop Grumman has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 26%. Still, forecasts suggest that Northrop Grumman's future ROE will drop to 27% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Northrop Grumman's performance.

Specifically, we decided to study Beacon Roofing Supply's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Beacon Roofing Supply\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Beacon Roofing Supply is:\n\n16% = US$339m ÷ US$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit.

Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 23%, we aren't very excited.

So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.

So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Beacon Roofing Supply's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Energizer Holdings\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Energizer Holdings is:\n\n40% = US$183m ÷ US$461m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.40 in profit.\n\nDoes Energizer Holdings Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Energizer Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (20%) in the Household Products industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 6 risks we have identified for Energizer Holdings visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Energizer Holdings' Debt And Its 40% Return On Equity\n\nWe think Energizer Holdings uses a significant amount of debt to maximize its returns, as it has a significantly higher debt to equity ratio of 7.72. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: Energizer Holdings may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Crown Castle International\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle International is:\n\n18% = US$1.5b ÷ US$8.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.\n\nDoes Crown Castle International Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Crown Castle International has a better ROE than the average (6.5%) in the REITs industry. roe\n\nThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Crown Castle International by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrown Castle International's Debt And Its 18% ROE\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Crown Castle International, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.60. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Crown Castle International may not be the best stock to buy.

      "title": "Are Universal Corporation's (NYSE:UVV) Mixed Financials The Reason For Its Gloomy Performance on The Stock Market?",
      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Universal's (NYSE:UVV) recent performance, when its stock has declined 3.9% over the past month. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Universal's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Universal\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Universal is:\n\n7.5% = US$104m ÷ US$1.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.07 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nUniversal's Earnings Growth And 7.5% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Universal's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 21%. However, the moderate 8.7% net income growth seen by Universal over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Universal's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 11% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Universal is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs Universal Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nThe high three-year median payout ratio of 87% (or a retention ratio of 13%) for Universal suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.\n\nBesides, Universal has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Universal can be open to many interpretations. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty respectable, the low profit retention could mean that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been paying reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. An improvement in its ROE could also help future earnings growth. So far, we've only made a quick discussion around the company's earnings growth. So it may be worth checking this freedetailed graph of Universal's past earnings, as well as revenue and cash flows  to get a deeper insight into the company's performance.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "title": "Is The Middleby Corporation (NASDAQ:MIDD) A High Quality Stock To Own?",
      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine The Middleby Corporation (NASDAQ:MIDD), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Middleby\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Middleby is:\n\n20% = US$485m ÷ US$2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.\n\nDoes Middleby Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Middleby has a higher ROE than the average (12%) in the Machinery industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Middleby visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiddleby's Debt And Its 20% ROE\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Middleby, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.07. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Middleby may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

      "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Briscoe Group's (NZSE:BGP) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.5% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Briscoe Group's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Briscoe Group\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Briscoe Group is:\n\n29% = NZ$88m ÷ NZ$299m (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each NZ$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made NZ$0.29 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Briscoe Group's Earnings Growth And 29% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Briscoe Group has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Briscoe Group's moderate 8.2% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Briscoe Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 8.4% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Briscoe Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs Briscoe Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nBriscoe Group has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 62%, meaning that it is left with only 38% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.\n\nBesides, Briscoe Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 70%. As a result, Briscoe Group's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 28% for future ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Briscoe Group's performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. Until now, we have only just grazed the surface of the company's past performance by looking at the company's fundamentals.

      "content": "With its stock down 15% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Accenture (NYSE:ACN). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Accenture's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Accenture\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Accenture is:\n\n31% = US$6.5b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.31 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Accenture's Earnings Growth And 31% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Accenture has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 17% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Accenture's moderate 12% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing Accenture's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 15% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Accenture Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nAccenture has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 40% (or a retention ratio of 60%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\n\nMoreover, Accenture is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 36%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 27%.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Accenture's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for PBF Energy\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PBF Energy is:\n\n13% = US$334m ÷ US$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit.\n\nDoes PBF Energy Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, PBF Energy has a lower ROE than the average (18%) in the Oil and Gas industry. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 5 risks we have identified for PBF Energy visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nPBF Energy's Debt And Its 13% ROE\n\nPBF Energy does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.67. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: PBF Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. As you might expect, the 11% net income decline reported by Corning is a bit of a surprise. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, when we compared Corning's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 15% in the same period. This is quite worrisome. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is GLW worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GLW is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Corning Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nCorning's declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 77% (or a retention ratio of 23%). The business is only left with a small pool of capital to reinvest - A vicious cycle that doesn't benefit the company in the long-run.\n\nAdditionally, Corning has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 41% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, it does look like Corning has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

      "title": "Luxfer Holdings PLC's (NYSE:LXFR) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong?",
      "content": "With its stock down 24% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Luxfer Holdings (NYSE:LXFR). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Luxfer Holdings'  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Luxfer Holdings\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Luxfer Holdings is:\n\n14% = US$29m ÷ US$207m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nLuxfer Holdings' Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Luxfer Holdings seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Luxfer Holdings' decent 8.7% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between Luxfer Holdings' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 8.8% in the same period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Luxfer Holdings''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Luxfer Holdings Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nWhile Luxfer Holdings has a three-year median payout ratio of 66% (which means it retains 34% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.\n\nMoreover, Luxfer Holdings is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of four years of paying a dividend.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Luxfer Holdings' performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Waste Management\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:\n\n27% = US$1.9b ÷ US$7.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.27 in profit.\n\nDoes Waste Management Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Waste Management has a better ROE than the average (10%) in the Commercial Services industry. roe\n\nThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Waste Management.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nWaste Management's Debt And Its 27% ROE\n\nWaste Management clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.79. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

      "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of US Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE:USFD).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nView our latest analysis for US Foods Holding\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for US Foods Holding is:\n\n4.3% = US$181m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.04 in profit.\n\nDoes US Foods Holding Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, US Foods Holding has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Consumer Retailing industry. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 3 risks we have identified for US Foods Holding visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS Foods Holding's Debt And Its 4.3% ROE\n\nUS Foods Holding does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.16. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

      "content": "Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) has had a rough three months with its share price down 4.2%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Mondelez International's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Mondelez International\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mondelez International is:\n\n15% = US$4.2b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Mondelez International's Earnings Growth And 15% ROE\n\nTo start with, Mondelez International's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Mondelez International's decent 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Mondelez International's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 5.3% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MDLZ? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Mondelez International Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nMondelez International has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 43% (or a retention ratio of 57%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\n\nMoreover, Mondelez International is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 49% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 17%.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Mondelez International's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Exelon\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exelon is:\n\n7.6% = US$1.8b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.\n\nDoes Exelon Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Exelon has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (9.2%). roe\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Exelon by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Exelon's Debt And Its 7.6% Return On Equity\n\nExelon does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.68. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.

      "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Accel Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:ACEL).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for Accel Entertainment\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Accel Entertainment is:\n\n27% = US$46m ÷ US$167m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.27 in profit.\n\nDoes Accel Entertainment Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Accel Entertainment has a higher ROE than the average (19%) in the Hospitality industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Accel Entertainment by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccel Entertainment's Debt And Its 27% ROE\n\nAccel Entertainment does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.05. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Accel Entertainment may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

      "content": "With its stock down 9.0% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Loews (NYSE:L). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Loews'  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Loews\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Loews is:\n\n10% = US$1.8b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nLoews' Earnings Growth And 10% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Loews seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Loews' five year net income decline of 7.3% raises the question as to why the decent ROE didn't translate into growth. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, we compared Loews' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 14% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Loews''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Loews Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nLoews' low three-year median payout ratio of 4.1% (or a retention ratio of 96%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nAdditionally, Loews has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we feel that Loews certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. While we won't completely dismiss the company, what we would do, is try to ascertain how risky the business is to make a more informed decision around the company.

      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Inghams Group Limited (ASX:ING).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Inghams Group\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Inghams Group is:\n\n49% = AU$86m ÷ AU$175m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.49 in profit.\n\nDoes Inghams Group Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Inghams Group has a better ROE than the average (8.1%) in the Food industry. roe\n\nThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Inghams Group visit our risks dashboard for free.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nInghams Group's Debt And Its 49% ROE\n\nIt appears that Inghams Group makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.13. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.

      "title": "Applied Materials, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMAT) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?",
      "content": "With its stock down 34% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Applied Materials'  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Applied Materials\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Applied Materials is:\n\n58% = US$6.8b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.58.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nApplied Materials' Earnings Growth And 58% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Applied Materials has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Applied Materials' moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Applied Materials' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 24% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Applied Materials''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Applied Materials Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nIn Applied Materials' case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 21% (or a retention ratio of 79%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.\n\nMoreover, Applied Materials is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 13% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Applied Materials' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

      "title": "ICU Medical, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ICUI) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financial Prospects Look Decent: Is The Market Wrong?",
      "content": "ICU Medical (NASDAQ:ICUI) has had a rough three months with its share price down 34%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ICU Medical's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ICU Medical\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ICU Medical is:\n\n1.9% = US$41m ÷ US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.02 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of ICU Medical's Earnings Growth And 1.9% ROE\n\nIt is quite clear that ICU Medical's ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 10%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. ICU Medical was still able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ICU Medical's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 15% in the same period, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if ICU Medical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs ICU Medical Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nICU Medical doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like ICU Medical has some positive aspects to its business. That is, a decent growth in earnings backed by a high rate of reinvestment. However, we do feel that that earnings growth could have been higher if the business were to improve on the low ROE rate. Especially given how the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

      "title": "What Elixirr International plc's (LON:ELIX) ROE Can Tell Us",
      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Elixirr International plc (LON:ELIX).\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Elixirr International\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Elixirr International is:\n\n12% = UK£10m ÷ UK£86m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated £0.12 in profit.\n\nDoes Elixirr International Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Elixirr International has a similar ROE to the average in the Professional Services industry classification (14%). roe\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Elixirr International's Debt And Its 12% Return On Equity\n\nOne positive for shareholders is that Elixirr International does not have any net debt! Its solid ROE indicates a good business, especially when you consider it is not using leverage. After all, with cash on the balance sheet, a company has a lot more optionality in good times and bad.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this  free list of interesting companies.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.
