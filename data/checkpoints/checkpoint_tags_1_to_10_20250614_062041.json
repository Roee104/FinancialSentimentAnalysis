For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.85 per share, delivering a surprise of 33.18%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Gartner lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nGartner has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 7, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.37 per share, while it actually produced $0.54 per share, a surprise of 45.95%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nFor Allegheny Technologies, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAllegheny Technologies has an Earnings ESP of +0.76% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 2, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

      "content": "Salisbury Bancorp (SAL) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.65 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.72 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bank holding company would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of -2.60%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nSalisbury Bancorp , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Northeast industry, posted revenues of $14.63 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.36%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.39 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSalisbury Bancorp shares have lost about 10.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Salisbury Bancorp?\n\nWhile Salisbury Bancorp has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Salisbury Bancorp: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.82 on $15.2 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.20 on $61.7 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Northeast is currently in the bottom 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nMidland States Bancorp (MSBI), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on January 26.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nMidland States Bancorp's revenues are expected to be $81.4 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nGFI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12, while FNV has a forward P/E of 41.47. We also note that GFI has a PEG ratio of 1.41. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FNV currently has a PEG ratio of 10.37.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for GFI is its P/B ratio of 2.46. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FNV has a P/B of 4.55.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help GFI earn a Value grade of B, while FNV has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nGFI is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that GFI is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Semiconductor ETFs in Focus Ahead of Q4 Earnings",
      "content": "The semiconductor space has been surging over the past three months on improving demand from chips suppliers, data centers, PC manufacturers, and mobile phone producers, as well as China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained more than 30% from a two-year low in mid-October, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, which added about 10% in the same period.\r\n\r\nAs such, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have gained 25.7%, 26.3%, 29.2% and 23.3%, respectively, over the past three months. The strong trend is likely to continue in the weeks ahead as the Q4 earnings season picks up pace. Texas Instruments TXN came up with robust results, beating revenue and earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. The result is expected to add fuel to the sector.\r\n\r\nEasing inflation and hopes of a less hawkish Fed fueled the rally in the overall tech sector. Additionally, the analyst Barclays Capital upped its stance on some chip stocks ahead of earnings, suggesting that the worst might be over for semiconductors (read: Is the Worst Over for Semiconductor Stocks & ETFs?).\r\n\r\nSemiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets, to planes and weapons. The demand will continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.\r\n\r\nThe rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has been leading to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.\r\n\r\nSome other well-known players in the space, such as Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q4 earnings unfold. SOXQ is largely concentrated on four firms with a combined share of 28.2%, followed by 24.6% for SOXX, 23.1% for SMH and 13.6% for FTXL.\r\n\r\nPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nInside Our Earnings Prediction\n\nIntel is slated to release earnings after market close on Jan 26. It has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered an earnings surprise of 11.36%, on average, for the preceding four quarters.\r\n\r\nQualcomm has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.92%. The stock witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered an earnings surprise of 5.36% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Feb 2 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA, expected to report on Feb 22, has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.31%, on average, over the past four quarters. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.11%. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 12.20% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. The company is slated to report earnings on Jan 31 after the closing bell.\n\nConclusion\n\nThough the stocks have an unfavorbale Zacks Rank, semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead as SOXX, SMH and FTXL have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 or 2. This suggests outperformance in the weeks ahead (read: ETFs to Play Nasdaq's Fastest Start Since 2019).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Reasons to Retain AmerisourceBergen (ABC) in Your Portfolio",
      "content": "AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC is well-poised for growth on the back of its robust U.S. Healthcare Solutions business and product launches. Intense competition, though, remains a concern.\n\nShares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player have gained 12% compared with the industry’s increase of 4.7% in the past six months. The S&P 500 Index has increased 0.7% in the same time frame.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $33.26 billion, AmerisourceBergen is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies, focused on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. The company’s earnings are anticipated to improve 8.6% over the next five years. It beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 2.51%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat’s Driving Growth?\n\nAmerisourceBergen made a strategic evaluation of its reporting structure to represent its expanded international presence, following the buyout of Alliance Healthcare in 2021. As a result, ABC realigned its reporting structure under two reportable segments, namely U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions in fiscal 2022.\n\nFollowing the segment realignment, U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Proforma), MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group and ICS 3PL. The segment benefits from increasing volume and an expanding customer base.\n\nStrong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the segment in the coming quarters.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, revenues at this segment totaled $54.8 billion, indicating a rise of 4.7% on a year-over-year basis on the back of higher specialty product sales and overall market growth. However, lower revenues from commercial COVID-19 treatments partially offset this upside. Segmental operating income was $578.4 million, up 14% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigher gross profit (which included fees earned from the distribution of government-owned COVID-19 treatments and a gross profit on sales from specialty physician practices) contributed to the upside. With respect to the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenues are expected to grow 6-8%. Operating income at the segment is anticipated to grow 2-4%.\n\nIn September 2022, AmerisourceBergen signed a definitive agreement to acquire Germany-based PharmaLex Holding GmbH for €1.28 billion ($1.3 billion) in cash. PharmaLex is a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry, owned by funds advised by AUCTUS Capital Partners AG. It has a global reach, with a significant footprint in Europe and the United States, and a growing presence in other parts of the world. The acquisition of this Germany-based company will enhance ABC’s global portfolio of solutions to support manufacturer partners across the pharmaceutical development and commercialization journey.\n\nLast year, ABC collaborated with TrakCel, the leading innovator of cellular orchestration solutions, to launch an integrated technology platform for accelerating patient access to prescribed cell and gene therapies and providing complete visibility throughout the treatment process.\n\nThe acquisition of Alliance Healthcare strongly drove AmerisourceBergen’s international segment revenues in fiscal 2022.\n\nAdjusted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $11.30-$11.60 for fiscal 2023, implying 2-5% growth from the fiscal 2022 level. ABC estimates revenue growth of 5-7% for fiscal 2023.\n\nWhat’s Hurting the Stock?\n\nAmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related healthcare services market. The generic industry is facing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, global competitors and regulatory challenges. ABC encounters additional competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies. Increased competition will affect its business.\n\nEstimate Trend\n\nAmerisourceBergen has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved north to $11.50 per share from $11.48.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $62.24 billion, suggesting growth of 4.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. The earnings estimate of $2.59 per share for the same time-period implies an increase of 0.4% year over year.\n\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation Price AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price\n\nAmerisourceBergen Corporation price | AmerisourceBergen Corporation Quote\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV and McKesson Corporation MCK.\n\nShockWave Medical, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 27.7% for 2023. SWAV’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 146.10%.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nShockWave Medical has lost 12% against the industry’s 2.8% increase in the past six months.\n\nAMN Healthcare, sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%. AMN’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 10.96%.\n\nAMN Healthcare has lost 14.4% compared with the industry’s 5.6% decline in the past six months.\n\nMcKesson, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 10.1%.

      "title": "Capitol Federal Financial (CFFN) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Lag Estimates",
      "content": "Capitol Federal Financial (CFFN) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -7.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this holding company for Capitol Federal Savings Bank would post earnings of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of -6.67%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nCapitol Federal , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Savings and Loan industry, posted revenues of $51.18 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.62%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $51.12 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nCapitol Federal shares have lost about 2.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Capitol Federal?\n\nWhile Capitol Federal has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Capitol Federal: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.12 on $50.57 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.47 on $205.09 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - Savings and Loan is currently in the bottom 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Heritage Financial (HFWA), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on January 26.\n\nThis bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nHeritage Financial's revenues are expected to be $69.7 million, up 20.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Key Predictions as General Motors (GM) Gears Up for Q4 Earnings",
      "content": "General Motors GM is slated to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 31, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.63 per share and $41.54 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ fourth-quarter earnings per share has been revised downward by a penny over the past seven days. The bottom-line projection, however, indicates year-over-year growth of 20.7%. The top-line estimate implies year-over-year growth of 23.7%.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, GM beat earnings estimates on better-than-expected profits from North America and International segments. Over the trailing four quarters, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, with the average surprise being 13.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise General Motors Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company Quote\n\nFactors Shaping Q4 Earnings\n\nGeneral Motors was the top-selling carmaker in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022. GM’s total fourth-quarter U.S. sales increased 41.4% year over year to 623,261 vehicles. While Buick deliveries skid 6.5% year over year, sales of the other three brands — Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac — posted double-digit year-over-year percentage gains. Sales of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac jumped 43.3%, 42.3% and 74.8%, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMNA segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 798,000 units, implying an increase from 579,000 units in the fourth quarter of 2021. Thanks to higher unit sales and rising vehicle prices, the consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $34,277 million, implying a rise from $26,865 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for operating profit from the segment is pegged at $3,367 million, indicating an increase of 55.5% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMI segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 215,000 units, implying an increase from 163,000 units in the fourth quarter of 2021. The consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $4,479 million, indicating a rise from $3,451 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for the operating profit from the segment is pegged at $288 million, indicating growth from $275 million.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the GM Financial unit is pegged at $3,258 million, up from $3,232 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. However. the company’s dimmed 2022 EBIT outlook from the segment raises concern. The consensus mark for GM Financial’s operating profit is $775 million, implying a fall from $1,180 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus mark for the GM Cruise unit’s operating loss stands at $445 million, widening from $349 million incurred in the year-ago period.\n\nWhile higher-year-over-year shipments and revenues from GMNA and GMI segments bode well, weak forecasts from GM Financial and GM Cruise dim the overall fourth-quarter view. It is also to be noted that high commodity costs, including platinum group metals and steel prices, are likely to have played spoilsports. General Motors expects headwinds from commodity inflation and logistical challenges to be around more than $5 billion higher from 2021 levels as well as the prior projection. This further softens the outlook for the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Motors this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here\n\nEarnings ESP: It has an Earnings ESP of +4.15%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.70 per share is pegged 7 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nWhile an earnings beat appears uncertain for General Motors, here are a few players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:\n\nLear LEA will release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2, before the opening bell. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.78% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lear’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.52 per share and $5.26 billion, respectively. LEA surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 18%.\n\nRivian Automotive RIVN will release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 28, after the closing bell. The company has an Earnings ESP of +13.17% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rivian’s to-be-reported quarter’s loss and revenues is pegged at $1.72 per share and $771 million, respectively. RIVN surpassed earnings estimates two of the trailing four quarters for as many misses, with the average negative surprise being 12.6%.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because T. Rowe is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TROW in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.73 per share for TROW, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TROW, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.52% heading into earnings season.\n\nT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nT. Rowe Price Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that TROW has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for T. Rowe, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

      "title": "Farmers National Banc (FMNB) Lags Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates",
      "content": "Farmers National Banc (FMNB) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.42 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -6.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bank would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of 4.35%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nFarmers National , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, posted revenues of $37.63 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.66%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $39.24 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nFarmers National shares have added about 1.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Farmers National?\n\nWhile Farmers National has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Farmers National: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.50 on $51.8 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.02 on $205.85 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Midwest is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nFirst Merchants (FRME), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on January 26.\n\nThis bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +31.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFirst Merchants' revenues are expected to be $171.4 million, up 34.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "Want Better Returns? Don't Ignore These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
      "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Booking Holdings (BKNG) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $22.27 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 22, 2023.\n\nBKNG has an Earnings ESP figure of 8.22%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $22.27 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.57.\n\nBKNG is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Alibaba (BABA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSlated to report earnings on February 23, 2023, Alibaba holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.32 a share 29 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 3% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.25.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, BKNG and BABA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

      "title": "Is Trending Stock Upstart Holdings, Inc. (UPST) a Buy Now?",
      "content": "Upstart Holdings, Inc. (UPST) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned +45.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, to which Upstart Holdings, Inc. belongs, has gained 50.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Upstart Holdings, Inc. is expected to post a loss of $0.48 per share, indicating a change of -153.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of -$0.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -101.3%. This estimate has changed -16.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$0.06 indicates a change of -100% from what Upstart Holdings, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -126.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Upstart Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPST _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Upstart Holdings, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $133.29 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -56.3%. The $828.94 million and $707.6 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.3% and -14.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nUpstart Holdings, Inc. reported revenues of $157.23 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -31.2%. EPS of -$0.24 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $171.67 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -8.41%. The EPS surprise was -242.86%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Upstart Holdings, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nUpstart Holdings, Inc. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Upstart Holdings, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&G falls in, has lost 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor P&G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $80.64 billion and $83.86 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nP&G reported revenues of $20.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $1.59 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.81%.

      "content": "Zoom Video Communications (ZM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this video-conferencing company have returned +6.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Zoom Video belongs, has gained 12.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nZoom Video is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 points to a change of -22.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.59 indicates a change of -9% from what Zoom Video is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Zoom Video.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ZM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Zoom Video, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.1 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.38 billion and $4.59 billion estimates indicate +6.7% and +4.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nZoom Video reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.41%. The EPS surprise was +27.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nZoom Video is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Zoom Video.

      "title": "How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Business Services Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
      "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Visa (V) earns a Zacks Rank #3 one day from its next quarterly earnings release on January 26, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.02 a share.\n\nVisa's Earnings ESP sits at 0.77%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.02 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.\n\nV is one of just a large database of Business Services stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Avis Budget Group (CAR).\n\nSlated to report earnings on February 13, 2023, Avis Budget Group holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $7.35 a share 19 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Avis Budget Group is $6.66, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 10.36%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, V and CAR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

For the current and next fiscal years, $2.4 billion and $2.71 billion estimates indicate +18.2% and +12.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nTeladoc reported revenues of $611.4 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.2%. EPS of -$0.45 for the same period compares with -$0.53 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $609.45 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.32%. The EPS surprise was +23.73%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTeladoc is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Teladoc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Computer and Technology Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
      "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Perion Network (PERI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.79 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 8, 2023.\n\nPerion Network's Earnings ESP sits at 13.4%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.79 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.70.\n\nPERI is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is NetApp (NTAP).\n\nSlated to report earnings on February 22, 2023, NetApp holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.34 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NetApp is $1.31, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.03%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPERI and NTAP's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

      "content": "When it comes to short-term investing or trading, they say \"the trend is your friend.\" And there's no denying that this is the most profitable strategy. But making sure of the sustainability of a trend to profit from it is easier said than done.\n\nThe trend often reverses before exiting the trade, leading to a short-term capital loss for investors. So, for a profitable trade, one should confirm factors such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. that could keep the momentum in the stock alive.\n\nOur \"Recent Price Strength\" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.\n\nAxa Sa (AXAHY) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for \"trend\" investors.\n\nA solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. AXAHY is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 23.1% over this period.\n\nHowever, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 9.5% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company.\n\nMoreover, AXAHY is currently trading at 80.7% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.\n\nLooking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nAnother factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.\n\nSo, the price trend in AXAHY may not reverse anytime soon.\n\nIn addition to AXAHY, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

      "content": "Abbott (ABT) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.90 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.32 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.44%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of infant formula, medical devices and drugs would post earnings of $0.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering a surprise of 26.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nAbbott , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $10.09 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.47%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.47 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAbbott shares have added about 2.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Abbott?\n\nWhile Abbott has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Abbott: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1 on $9.44 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.39 on $39.23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the top 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, SurModics (SRDX), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.\n\nThis drug delivery technology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -392.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nSurModics' revenues are expected to be $24.19 million, up 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil and gas producer would post earnings of $1.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of 0.53%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nHess , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, posted revenues of $3.05 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.50%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.26 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Hess: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

      "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Mastercard Incorporated MA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because Mastercard is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MA in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.57 per share for MA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.36% heading into earnings season.\n\nMastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMastercard Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Mastercard Incorporated Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that MA has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Mastercard, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session.

Revenues are expected to be $83.94 million, up 201.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Ardmore Shipping, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 27.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 22.4% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nThis surge was most likely attributable to the recovery of the share price after they dived last week when CPRX announced that it has received a notice letter stating that Teva Pharmaceuticals filed an abbreviated new drug application (\"ANDA\") to the FDA for a generic version of Firdapse, Catalyst’s sole marketed drug.\n\nThis specialty drug company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +122.2%. Revenues are expected to be $56.61 million, up 47.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Catalyst, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 23.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on CPRX going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "title": "Time to Buy These Top-Rated Industrial Product Stocks?",
      "content": "Opportunity appears to be brewing in the Industrial Products sector, with Cintas CTAS and Unifirst UNF stock sticking out at the moment.\n\nThese two stocks have acted as a defensive hedge against inflation with a collective +15% total return (including dividends) over the last year compared to the S&P 500’s -1%. Even better, over the last five years the combined total return of the Uniform and Related stocks is +149% to crush the benchmarks +52%.\n\nWith that being said, let’s take a look at the upside left in these two standout Industrial Product stocks.\n\nBrief Overview\n\nCintas has an international reach providing specialized services throughout North America with operations in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nCintas designs, manufactures, and implements corporate identity uniform programs and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, and first aid among other safety products for diversified businesses.\n\nSimilarly, Unifirst’s business involves rental leases and the sale of work clothing, uniforms, protective apparel, career wear, and facility service products with operations in the United States and Europe.\n\nGrowth Outlook\n\nBoth Cintas and Unifirst stock land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimate revisions.\n\nLooking at Cintas, earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have gone up 3% over the last 60 days for fiscal 2023 at $12.68 per share. This would be a 12% increase from fiscal 2022 earnings of $11.28 per share. Plus, earnings are forecasted to grow another 10% in FY24 with earnings estimates slightly up as well over the last two months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOn the top line, sales are anticipated to grow 11% in FY23 and rise another 6% in FY24 to $9.22 billion. More impressive, Fiscal 2024 would be a 34% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $6.89 billion.\n\nPivoting to Unifirst, earnings estimates have gone up 3% over the last 30 days for fiscal 2023 to $7.48 per share. Fiscal 2023 would represent 10% growth from FY22 earnings of $6.81 a share. Even better, earnings are projected to grow another 10% in FY24 with earnings estimates going up 2% over the last month.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnifirst sales are expected to jump 8% in FY23 and rise another 4% in FY24 to $2.25 billion. More importantly, with 2019 sales at $1.80 billion, fiscal 2024 would be a 25% increase from pre-pandemic levels.\n\nPerformance & Valuation\n\nThe solid top and bottom line growth make Cintas and Unifirst stock look poised to continue their strong performances as the broader market and economy have struggled amid higher inflation.\n\nOver the last year, Cintas stock is up +15% Vs. Unifirst’s +2% with both noticeably outperforming the S&P 500’s -9%. Looking at the last decade, when including dividends, Cintas’s total return is now an astonishing +1,069% to easily top the broader market although UniFirst’s +149% has lagged the benchmark. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile Cintas’s performance has topped its peer, Unifirst’s valuation stands out with UNF stock trading at $195 per share and 25.6X forward earnings. Unifirst trades 24% below its decade-high of 34X and closer to the median of 23.6X.\n\nAs for Cintas, its stock trades at $440 per share and 34.5X forward earnings which is 18% beneath its own decade-long high of 42.3X but further above the median of 26.8X. The expected growth of both stocks in the upcoming years supports their valuations despite trading higher than the benchmark’s 18.1X forward earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDividends\n\nTaking a glance at dividends, Cintas’s 1.05% annual dividend yield slightly tops Unifirst’s 0.65% with both stocks’ dividends lagging the S&P 500’s average yield of 1.5%.\n\nHowever, their respectable return to shareholders has certainly been a plus considering Cintas and Unifirst stock have outperformed the broader market over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCintas and Unifirst stocks are both viable options for exposure in the Industrial Products sector and while their business models are similar there should be more than enough room for both companies as it relates to uniform services. This space looks set to expand considering Cintas continued dominance and Unifirst’s expansive growth over the last few years.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "2 Stocks to Consider Buying Before Earnings This Week",
      "content": "This week’s earnings will be important for investors to get a clearer picture of the outlook for many larger-cap stocks that are crucial to the broader stock market and economy.\n\nWith that being said, here are two stocks investors shouldn’t overlook and may want to consider buying going into their fourth-quarter releases.\n\nInternational Business Machines IBM\n\nThe first stock investors will want to pay attention to is International Business Machines (IBM) which is set to report Q4 earnings on January 25.\n\nEvolving into a cloud and data provider, IBM has shown the ability to manage its bottom line effectively despite a challenging economy and slowing top-line growth.\n\nIBM currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with its current Fiscal year 2022 and Q4 earnings estimate revisions trending higher again despite fiscal 2023 earnings estimates slightly declining. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ4 Preview: Fourth-quarter earnings estimates have now gone up to $3.60 per share in the last week compared to $3.57 a share, which is a sign that IBM could top bottom-line expectations. This would also represent 7% year-over-year growth from Q4 2021 and round out IBM’s Fiscal 2022 earnings at $9.14 a share, a 15% increase from FY21. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSales are projected at $15.55 billion for Q4 which would be a -7% decrease from the prior year quarter but shows IBM is making the best of its operating environment. Total sales for FY22 would be $59.39 billion, a -16% YoY decrease with sales at $70.79 billion in 2021.\n\nEarnings ESP: As fore mentioned IBM is expected to top Q4 earnings expectations with an Expected Surprise Prediction of 1.90% as the Zacks Consensus is $3.60 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus is $3.67 a share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway: Despite the dip on the top line, IBM’s management seems to be effectively navigating the challenging operating environment as indicated in the company’s earnings. On that note, a Q4 earnings beat and better-than-expected guidance could lead to more upside in IBM stock which is very impressive considering the difficulties higher inflation has inflicted on most tech companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlus, over the last two years, IBM is now up +19% to outperform the S&P 500’s +3% and the Nasdaq’s -17% as the company continues to diversify its business operations.\n\nUnited Rentals URI\n\nAnother stock investors may want to consider buying this week is United Rentals (URI) which is set to report earnings on January 25. As the largest equipment rental company in the world, United Rentals’ stock continues to look very intriguing.\n\nUnited Rentals’ customer base is loyal and includes construction, industrial, and utility companies that also include municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors, and homeowners among others.\n\nUnited Rentals currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimates trending higher for the company’s current fiscal 2022 and FY23. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ4 Preview: United Rentals looks poised to have another strong quarter on the bottom line. Fourth quarter earnings are expected to be up 36% YoY at $10.09 per share compared to $7.39 a share in Q4 2021.\n\nThis would have United Rentals finishing Fiscal 2022 with earnings up a stellar 48% at $32.60 per share compared to $22.06 per share in 2021. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOn the top line, Q4 sales are expected at $3.29 billion, up 18% from the prior year quarter. More impressively United Rentals would post 20% top-line growth for FY22 rounding out the year with sales at $11.64 billion compared to $9.72 billion in 2021.\n\nEarnings ESP: After beating earnings expectations in four consecutive quarters the trend could continue with the Zacks Consensus for URI’s Q4 earnings at $10.09 per share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $10.22 a share. This indicates United Rentals could beat expectations by 1.31%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway: The top and bottom line growth for United Rentals has been very impressive and the rising earnings estimate revisions going into Q4 earnings is a sign that URI’s stock could continue its stellar performance, up 26% over the last year and 662% over the last decade to largely outperform the S&P 500.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIBM and United Rentals are two companies that continue to outperform on their bottom lines and this could lead to more upside in these stocks. Their ability to effectively manage operating costs in a challenging economy and operating environment is very impressive and could separate IBM and URI stock from others in 2023.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenues are expected to be $426.94 million, up 16.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Evoqua Water, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

      "title": "Pentair (PNR) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?",
      "content": "Pentair plc PNR is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.\n\nQ3 Results & Surprise History\n\nPentair’s revenues and earnings improved in third-quarter 2022 and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Pentair beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.9%.\n\nQ4 Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $995 million, indicating growth of 0.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The same for earnings is pegged at 79 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.\n\nPentair plc Price and EPS Surprise Pentair plc Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPentair plc price-eps-surprise | Pentair plc Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Pentair for the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is precisely the case here.\r\n\r\nYou can uncover the best stocks before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Pentair is 0.90%. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Pentair currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, Pentair’s inventory levels increased to support market demand and ongoing supply-chain challenges. However, in the third quarter of 2022, it saw the normalization of inventory levels within residential distributor channels. PNR had planned to clear out nearly $200 million of the channel inventory pool in the fourth quarter. These optimization efforts are expected to have impacted volume levels in the quarter under review. Also, the pool business has historically tended to be at lower levels in the fourth compared to the second and third quarters due to seasonal factors. These factors are likely to get reflected in PNR’s top-line performance in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nPentair has been witnessing a tight supply of raw materials such as metals, resins and electronics along with rising logistics costs. While it has been implementing pricing actions and focusing on productivity improvements that may have negated these headwinds, supply-chain pressures and inflationary costs are likely to have weighed on the quarter’s performance.\r\n\r\nDuring the first nine months of 2022, the Consumer Solutions segment saw a year-over-year decline in the backlog. Shipments outpaced new orders during the period as customers balanced the need to place new orders with market demand and channel inventory levels. This downward trend may continue in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the backlog is expected to return to historical levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Solutions segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $644 million, suggesting an improvement of 2% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit for the quarter is pinned at $147 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 8%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial & Flow Technologies segment’s revenues is pegged at $363 million, indicating an improvement of 1% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit stands at $58 million, suggesting growth of 7% from the $54 million reported a year ago.\n\nPrice Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of the company have declined 42.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 48.6% plunge.\n\nStocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates\n\nHere are some Industrial Products stocks, which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:\r\n\r\nDeere & Co.

      "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Arista Networks (ANET). This company, which is in the Zacks Communication - Components industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this cloud networking company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 18.22%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Arista Networks was expected to post earnings of $1.05 per share, but it reported $1.25 per share instead, representing a surprise of 19.05%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.92 per share, while it actually produced $1.08 per share, a surprise of 17.39%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Arista Networks lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nArista Networks currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.14%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 13, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

      "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering ServiceNow (NOW), which belongs to the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry.\n\nThis maker of software that automates companies' technology operations has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.91%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, ServiceNow was expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, but it reported $1.96 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.95%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.53 per share, while it actually produced $1.62 per share, a surprise of 5.88%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for ServiceNow lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nServiceNow currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.11%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 25, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

      "title": "Banco Bilbao (BBVA) Is Up 0.29% in One Week: What You Should Know",
      "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Banco Bilbao (BBVA), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Banco Bilbao currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if BBVA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this bank holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor BBVA, shares are up 0.29% over the past week while the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry is up 0.44% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 16.14% compares favorably with the industry's 9.08% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Banco Bilbao have risen 35.53%, and are up 11.32% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 7.54% and -7.08%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to BBVA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BBVA is currently averaging 1,104,997 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with BBVA.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BBVA's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.04 to $1.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that BBVA is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Banco Bilbao on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Investors might want to bet on Shiseido Co. (SSDOY), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Shiseido Co. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Shiseido Co. rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Shiseido Co.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2022, this company is expected to earn $0.66 per share, which is a change of 106.3% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Shiseido Co. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.4%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Shiseido Co. to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "What Makes Transocean (RIG) a New Strong Buy Stock",
      "content": "Transocean (RIG) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Transocean is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Transocean imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Transocean\n\nThis offshore oil and gas drilling contractor is expected to earn -$0.55 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of 25.7%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Transocean. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10.4%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Transocean to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "title": "BrightSphere Investment Group (BSIG) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?",
      "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at BrightSphere Investment Group (BSIG), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. BrightSphere Investment Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if BSIG is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this asset manager holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor BSIG, shares are up 6.53% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 19.51% compares favorably with the industry's 8.23% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of BrightSphere Investment Group have risen 22.69%, and are up 5.24% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 7.54% and -7.08%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to BSIG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BSIG is currently averaging 196,628 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with BSIG.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BSIG's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.70 to $1.71 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that BSIG is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep BrightSphere Investment Group on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Electronics - Miscellaneous Components sector might want to consider either Littelfuse (LFUS) or Universal Display Corp. (OLED). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Littelfuse has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Universal Display Corp. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that LFUS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nLFUS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.52, while OLED has a forward P/E of 32.13. We also note that LFUS has a PEG ratio of 1.46. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. OLED currently has a PEG ratio of 1.82.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for LFUS is its P/B ratio of 2.98. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, OLED has a P/B of 5.18.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, LFUS holds a Value grade of B, while OLED has a Value grade of D.\n\nLFUS sticks out from OLED in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that LFUS is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The five biggest tech players — Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, and Alphabet GOOGL — are set to report.\r\n\r\nThe technology sector, which was hit the hardest by soaring yields and a hawkish Fed, showed a strong comeback to start 2023. Hopes that the Fed will soon wrap up its inflation-fighting campaign and optimism over cooling inflation have compelled investors to buy beaten-up technology stocks (read: 5 Tech ETFs Riding High on Sectors' Comeback to Start 2023).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is expected to release results on Jan 24 after market close, while Meta Platforms will report on Feb 1. Alphabet, Apple and Amazon are scheduled to release their earnings on Feb 2.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.34%. According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe stock witnessed a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past 30 days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. Microsoft’s earnings track is impressive, with the last four-quarter earnings surprise being 2.64%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a substantial earnings decline of 7.8% and a modest revenue growth of 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 33%) and has lost about 1.8% over the past three months (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +6.88%. The social media giant saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the past seven days. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be reported quarter indicates a substantial year-over-year earnings decline of 42.2%. Revenues are also expected to decrease 7%. Meta Platforms delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.55%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 26%). Shares of META have gained more than 10% in the past three months.\r\n\r\nAlphabet\r\n\r\nAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -4.85%. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings surprise track over the past four quarters is not good, with the beat being negative 2.28%, on average. Earnings are expected to decline 23.5%, while revenues are expected to grow 2.1% from the year-ago quarter. However, Alphabet falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 35%). The Internet behemoth has shed about 3% in the past three months.\r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.42%. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for first-quarter fiscal 2023, and its earnings surprise history is strong. It delivered an earnings surprise of 6.26%, on average, over the past four quarters. Apple is expected to report an earnings decline of 8.1% and a revenue decline of 2.46% from the year-ago quarter. It belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 5%). The stock has declined 5.5% in the past three-month timeframe.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -16.30%. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate represents a substantial year-over-year earnings decline of 87.8% and revenue growth of 5.92%. Amazon’s earnings surprise history is impressive, with an average beat of 129.88% for the last four quarters. The stock falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 13%). The online e-commerce behemoth has witnessed a share price fall of 18.6% in the past three months.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to play these stocks with the help of ETFs.

      "title": "American Express (AXP) to Post Q4 Earnings: What You Should Know",
      "content": "American Express Company AXP is set to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 27, before the opening bell.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the diversified financial services company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.47 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%, primarily due to continued business momentum and a solid revenue stream. American Express also benefited from better volumes and higher Card Member spending, due to a significant increase in Travel and Entertainment spending. However, the positives were partially offset by higher operating costs.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.\n\nWhat Do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 per share for fourth-quarter earnings has witnessed no movement in the past week. The consensus mark is flat with the year-ago reported figure. American Express beat earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 11.3%. This is depicted in the graph below.\n\nAmerican Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $14.3 billion, suggesting a jump of 17.3% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect fourth-quarter revenues to witness a 13.2% year-over-year increase.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nAmEx is likely to have witnessed improved volumes in the to-be-reported quarter, a trend seen over the last few quarters. It might have expanded, owing to total network volumes and billed business volumes. A rise in the overall spending level is likely to have boosted Discount revenues, AXP’s largest revenue driver.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Discount revenues indicates 17.3% year-over-year growth. Our estimate suggests an 11.4% year-over-year increase in Discount revenues for the quarter under review.\n\nTravel and Entertainment (T&E) is rapidly increasing in most parts of the world, overcoming the COVID-19 woes. T&E-related spending is expected to have increased in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fees, commissions and other revenues are likely to have improved on the back of an uptick in travel-related revenues. Card acquisitions in some of AXP’s largest travel co-brand portfolios are likely to have increased.\n\nStory continues\n\nCards-in-force is expected to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. Both the consensus mark and our estimate for total cards-in-force indicate a 10% year-over-year increase.\n\nAmerican Express’s net interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The consensus mark for AXP’s net interest income suggests an upside of 28.3% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect the figure to increase 23.6% from the year-ago period. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income indicates a 55.4% year-over-year increase while our estimate suggests a 49.7% year-over-year surge.\n\nThe above-mentioned factors are likely to have contributed to AXP’s fourth-quarter performance. However, the rising expenses in global commercial services, card member rewards, marketing and business development are expected to have partially offset the profits. Our estimate suggests total expense increase of 17.3% year over year in the quarter.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Express this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.\n\nEarnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -4.28%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $2.09 per share, much lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18.\n\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: American Express currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for American Express, here are some companies from the broader finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:\n\nAxos Financial, Inc. AX has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axos Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.24 per share, implying a 19.2% improvement from the year-ago figure. AX beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.6%.\n\nAon plc AON has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AON’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.67 per share, which witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against one downward movement. AON beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 2.8%.\n\nThe Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hartford Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.86 per share, which improved 1.1% in the past 60 days.

      "content": "Gatx (GATX) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.58 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.59%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this equipment finance company would post earnings of $1.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.12, delivering a surprise of -2.61%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nGatx , which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry, posted revenues of $322.7 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $321 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nGatx shares have added about 1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Gatx?\n\nWhile Gatx has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gatx: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.44 on $353.79 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.58 on $1.47 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Transportation - Equipment and Leasing is currently in the bottom 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Herc Holdings (HRI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 14.\n\nThis equipment rental supplier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +42.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nHerc Holdings' revenues are expected to be $773 million, up 33.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
