      "title": "Curtiss-Wright (CW) Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Sales Rise Y/Y",
      "content": "Curtiss-Wright Corporation CW reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.92 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02 by 3.3%. However, the bottom line rose 21% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nFor the full-year 2022, CW reported adjusted earnings of $8.13 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 per share by 1.2%. However, adjusted earnings increased 11% year over year.\n\nOperational Performance\n\nIn the quarter under review, the company’s net sales of $758 million went up 16% year over year. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $748 million by 1.4%.\n\nFor the full-year 2022, net sales came in at $2.55 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, net sales increased 4% year over year.\n\nThe operating income of $160 million surged 24% year over year. The adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points (bps) to 21.1%, driven by favorable overhead absorption on higher revenues in all three segments and the benefits of restructuring and ongoing company-wide operational excellence initiatives.\n\nCurtiss-Wright’s total backlog at the end of 2022 was $2.6 billion, up 19% from the 2021 level, reflecting strong demand in the Defense and Commercial Aerospace markets. New orders of $714 million increased 5% in the fourth quarter compared with the prior-year period, driven by solid demand in the aerospace & defense market and commercial market demand.\n\nCurtiss-Wright Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Curtiss-Wright Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCurtiss-Wright Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Curtiss-Wright Corporation Quote\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nAerospace & Industrial: Sales in this segment improved 8% year over year to $223 million, primarily attributable to higher commercial aerospace market revenues. The upside in revenues was mainly due to the strong demand for actuation and sensor products.\n\nFurther, higher general industrial market revenues, driven by the increased sale of industrial vehicle products, fueled the sales performance of the segment and increased sales of surface treatment services.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the operating income increased 2% to $41 million, the operating margin contracted 100 bps to 18.5%. The downside in the margin was mainly due to an unfavorable mix of actuation products, partially offset by favorable absorption of strong sales and the benefits of its ongoing operational excellence and pricing initiatives.\n\nDefense Electronics: Sales in this segment increased 18% year over year to $236 million. This increase was due to strong growth in defense market sales.\n\nThe operating income increased 33% to $70 million, while the operating margin increased 320 bps to 29.7%. The expansion can be attributed to the strong absorption of higher defense revenues.\n\nNaval & Power: Sales in this segment increased 20% year over year to $298 million due to the favorable impact of the arresting system acquisition and higher revenues from the Columbia-class submarine programs.\n\nThe unit’s operating income increased 26% to $60 million. The operating margin expanded 100 bps to 20.3%. This acceleration was due to the favorable absorption of higher organic revenues, a solid contribution from the arresting systems acquisition and the benefits of restructuring initiatives.\n\nFinancial Update\n\nCW’s cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2022 were $256.9 million compared with $171 million as of Dec 31, 2021.\n\nThe long-term debt was $1,051.9 million as of Dec 31, 2022 compared with $1,050.6 million as of Dec 31, 2021.\n\nThe operating cash outflow totaled $292 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $232 million in the prior-year period.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow at the end of the reported quarter was $299 million compared with the year-ago period’s $219 million.\n\n2023 Guidance\n\nCurtiss-Wright initiated its financial guidance for 2023. The company now expects adjusted earnings in the band of $8.65-$8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s full-year earnings is pegged at $8.65 per share, which lies at the lower end of the company’s guided range.\n\nThe company expects sales in the range of $2,655-$2,710 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its full-year sales is pegged at $2.68 billion, in line with the midpoint of the company’s guided range.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nCurtiss-Wright currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRecent Defense Releases\n\nSpirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. SPR reported a fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted loss of $1.46 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 31 cents. The bottom line also widened significantly from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 84 cents per share.\n\nTotal revenues of $1,320 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,378 million by 4.2%. However, the top line rose 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the higher production deliveries of the Boeing 737 and increased Defense and Space revenues.\n\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.’s LDOS fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.83 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 by 13.7%. The bottom line also improved 17% from the $1.56 per share registered a year ago.\n\nLeidos Holdings generated total revenues of $3,697 million in the quarter under consideration, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,609 million by 2.4%.

      "title": "Avista Corp. Reports Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022, Confirms 2023 Guidance",
      "content": "Avista Corporation\n\nSPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avista Corp. (NYSE: AVA) today reported net income of $155.2 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, compared to $147.3 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022, net income was $78.0 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $50.9 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n“Our 2022 consolidated earnings were better than our expectations, due to significant increases in the fair value of certain non-regulated investments,” said Avista President and CEO Dennis Vermillion.\n\n“I am proud of the way we worked together as a team to face high inflation and adverse market conditions, while safely maintaining our standard of providing reliable service for our customers. Despite these efforts, Avista Utilities' earnings were slightly below expectations due to higher power supply costs associated with extreme volatility in the power and natural gas markets across the western region, particularly in December.\n\n“AEL&P had a strong year with higher sales volumes, meeting our expectations.\n\n“Our regulatory outcomes are key to our success in 2023. The Washington Commission's approval of the settlement agreement in our rate cases in December was the first step. This month, we filed a multi-year rate plan in Idaho that would allow the Company to recover the cost of our ongoing investment in utility infrastructure and the increased operating costs experienced in 2022.\n\n“We are confirming our 2023 consolidated earnings guidance with a range of $2.27 to $2.47 per diluted share,” Vermillion added.\n\nSummary Results: Avista Corp.’s results for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the year ended Dec. 31, 2022 (year-to-date) as compared to the respective periods in 2021 are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands, except per-share data):\n\nFourth Quarter Year-to-Date 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net Income by Business Segment: Avista Utilities $ 52,660 $ 44,697 $ 117,901 $ 125,558 AEL&P 3,253 2,408 7,545 7,224 Other 22,043 3,772 29,730 14,552 Total net income $ 77,956 $ 50,877 $ 155,176 $ 147,334 Earnings per Diluted Share by Business Segment: Avista Utilities $ 0.71 $ 0.63 $ 1.61 $ 1.79 AEL&P 0.04 0.03 0.10 0.10 Other 0.30 0.05 0.41 0.21 Total earnings per diluted share $ 1.05 $ 0.71 $ 2.12 $ 2.10\n\nAnalysis of 2022 Consolidated Earnings\n\nThe table below presents the change in net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2022 as compared to the respective periods in 2021, as well as the various factors, shown on an after-tax basis, that caused such change (dollars in thousands, except per-share data):\n\nStory continues\n\nFourth Quarter Year-to-Date Net\r\nIncome (a) Earnings\r\nper Share Net\r\nIncome (a) Earnings\r\nper Share 2021 consolidated earnings $ 50,877 $ 0.71 $ 147,334 $ 2.10 Changes in net income and diluted earnings per share: Avista Utilities Electric utility margin (including intracompany) (b) (2,069 ) (0.03 ) 14,415 0.20 Natural gas utility margin (including intracompany) (c) 4,764 0.07 10,061 0.14 Other operating expenses (d) (4,486 ) (0.06 ) (29,490 ) (0.40 ) Depreciation and amortization (e) (934 ) (0.01 ) (15,887 ) (0.22 ) Interest expense (f) (3,957 ) (0.05 ) (9,683 ) (0.13 ) Other 2,263 0.03 (980 ) (0.01 ) Income tax at effective rate (g) 12,382 0.17 23,907 0.33 Dilution on earnings n/a (0.04 ) n/a (0.09 ) Total Avista Utilities 7,963 0.08 (7,657 ) (0.18 ) AEL&P 845 0.01 321 — Other businesses (h) 18,271 0.25 15,178 0.20 2022 consolidated earnings $ 77,956 $ 1.05 $ 155,176 $ 2.12\n\n(a) The tax impact of each line item was calculated using Avista Corp.'s statutory tax rate (federal and state combined) of 23.05 percent.  (b) Electric utility margin (operating revenues less resource costs) increased year over year and was impacted primarily by decreased authorized net power supply costs, as well as retail customer growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized a $3.6 million pre-tax expense under the Energy Recovery Mechanism (ERM), compared to a $0.6 million pre-tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2021.  (c) Natural gas utility margin (operating revenues less resource costs) increased and was impacted primarily by higher usage and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue.  (d) Other operating expenses increased primarily due to increased labor and benefits costs, insurance costs, outside service expenses, and information technology costs. Inflation broadly impacted our other operating expenses.  (e) Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to additions to utility plant.  (f) Interest expense increased due to a higher level of debt outstanding and an increase in interest rates in 2022.  (g) Our effective tax rate was negative 12.5 percent for 2022, compared to 7.5 percent for 2021. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to our Idaho and Washington completed general rate cases that allowed for a change in tax methodology.  (h) Earnings attributable to our other businesses increased primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our investment in a biotechnology company, which stems from an investment that was originally focused on the development of biofuels. Their patented biologic drug platform accelerates time to market for orally delivered antibody drugs and has advanced through testing stages, increasing the value of our investment.\n\nNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Non-GAAP) Financial Measures\n\nThe tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin, two financial measures that are considered “non-GAAP financial measures.” Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included (or excluded) in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, which for utility margin is utility operating revenues.\n\nThe presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance. We use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads (due to weather, economic or other conditions), rates, supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations. Changes in loads, as well as power and natural gas supply costs, are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms. Accordingly, the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms. We present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for Avista Utilities since each business has different cost sources, cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions, so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial. These measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. Reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below.\n\nThe following table presents Avista Utilities' operating revenues, resource costs and resulting utility margin (pre-tax and after-tax) for the three and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n\nOperating\r\nRevenues Resource\r\nCosts Utility\r\nMargin\r\n(Pre-Tax) Income\r\nTaxes (a) Utility\r\nMargin\r\n(Net of Tax) For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2022: Electric $ 296,262 $ 124,424 $ 171,838 $ 39,609 $ 132,229 Natural Gas 219,501 137,835 81,666 18,824 62,842 Less: Intracompany (18,990 ) (18,990 ) — — — Total $ 496,773 $ 243,269 $ 253,504 $ 58,433 $ 195,071 For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2021: Electric $ 273,343 $ 98,816 $ 174,527 $ 40,229 $ 134,298 Natural Gas 168,148 92,673 75,475 17,397 58,078 Less: Intracompany (22,664 ) (22,664 ) — — — Total $ 418,827 $ 168,825 $ 250,002 $ 57,626 $ 192,376 For the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022: Electric $ 1,146,823 $ 458,905 $ 687,918 $ 158,565 $ 529,353 Natural Gas 583,485 339,886 243,599 56,150 187,449 Less: Intracompany (66,493 ) (66,493 ) — — — Total $ 1,663,815 $ 732,298 $ 931,517 $ 214,715 $ 716,802 For the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2021: Electric $ 1,007,052 $ 337,866 $ 669,186 $ 154,248 $ 514,938 Natural Gas 473,313 242,789 230,524 53,136 177,388 Less: Intracompany (87,366 ) (87,366 ) — — — Total $ 1,392,999 $ 493,289 $ 899,710 $ 207,384 $ 692,326\n\n(a)    Income taxes for 2022 and 2021 were calculated using Avista Corp.'s statutory tax rate (federal and state combined) of 23.05 percent. In September and October 2021, new rates from our Idaho and Washington general rate cases went into effect. While there were base rate increases approved in each case, these base rate increases were offset by tax customer credits which resulted in no increase in customer billing rates. The general rate case outcomes did result in lower income tax expense, which represents a benefit from these cases. The lower taxes are not reflected in the 23.05 percent statutory tax rate presented in this table.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nLiquidity\n\nIn 2022, we issued $400 million of long-term debt and $138 million of common stock.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we increased our short-term borrowing capacity by $300 million, bringing our total capacity to $700 million. These additional facilities include a $150 million term loan expiring in March 2023, a $100 million revolving line of credit expiring in November 2023, and a $50 million letter of credit facility. At Dec. 31, 2022, we had $517 million outstanding under our short-term credit facilities, with $183 million of available liquidity.\n\nWe increased our short-term borrowing capacity due to increased purchased power and natural gas market prices in the fourth quarter. In 2023, we expect to reduce our short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt and through increased operating revenues including recovery of deferred power and natural gas costs and a return of margin deposits made with counterparties.\n\nDuring 2023, we expect to issue $200 million of long-term debt and $120 million of common stock to fund planned capital expenditures and reduce our short-term borrowings. We also expect to increase the capacity of our $400 million credit facility to $500 million in the second quarter.\n\nAEL&P also had $25 million of available liquidity under its committed line of credit that expires in November 2024.\n\nCapital Expenditures and Other Investments\n\nIn 2022, Avista Utilities’ capital expenditures were $443 million and AEL&P’s capital expenditures were $9 million.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to total $475 million at Avista Utilities and $16 million at AEL&P in 2023.\n\nIn addition, we expect to invest $15 million in 2023 at our other businesses related to non-regulated investment opportunities and economic development projects in our service territory.\n\n2023 Earnings Guidance and Outlook\n\nAvista Corp. is confirming its 2023 consolidated earnings guidance with a range of $2.27 to $2.47 per diluted share. Our guidance assumes timely and appropriate rate relief in all of our jurisdictions.\n\nWe expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $2.15 to $2.31 per diluted share. The mid-point of our Avista Utilities' guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the ERM. For 2023, we expect to be in the deadband of the ERM, with an increase to earnings of $0.03 per diluted share. We expect to manage our operating costs to an increase of 2 percent in 2023.\n\nOur 2023 earnings guidance range reflects unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 70 basis points, as well as regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 80 basis points. This results in an expected return on equity for Avista Utilities of approximately 7.9 percent in 2023.\n\nWe expect AEL&P to contribute in the range of $0.08 to $0.10 per diluted share.\n\nWe expect the other businesses to contribute in the range of $0.04 to $0.06 per diluted share.\n\nOur outlook for Avista Utilities and AEL&P assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation, temperatures, hydroelectric generation, and other operating conditions. Our guidance does not include the effect of unusual or non-recurring items until the effects are known and certain.\n\nNOTE: We will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on Feb. 22, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. ET to discuss this news release.

change in the use, availability or abundancy of water resources and/or rights needed for operation of our hydroelectric facilities, including impacts resulting from climate change;\n\nCyber and Technology Risk\n\ncyberattacks on the operating systems that are used in the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities and our natural gas distribution facilities, and cyberattacks on such systems of other energy companies with which we are interconnected, which could damage or destroy facilities or systems or disrupt operations for extended periods of time and result in the incurrence of liabilities and costs; cyberattacks on the administrative systems that are used in the administration of our business, including customer billing and customer service, accounting, communications, compliance and other administrative functions, and cyberattacks on such systems of our vendors and other companies with which we do business, resulting in the disruption of business operations, the release of private information and the incurrence of liabilities and costs; changes in costs that impede our ability to implement new information technology systems or to operate and maintain current production technology; changes in technologies, possibly making some of the current technology we utilize obsolete or introducing new cyber security risks; insufficient technology skills, which could lead to the inability to develop, modify or maintain our information systems;\n\nStrategic Risk\n\ngrowth or decline of our customer base due to new uses for our services or decline in existing services, including, but not limited to, the effect of the trend toward distributed generation at customer sites; the potential effects of negative publicity regarding our business practices, whether true or not, which could hurt our reputation and result in litigation or a decline in our common stock price; changes in our strategic business plans, which could be affected by any or all of the foregoing, including the entry into new businesses and/or the exit from existing businesses and the extent of our business development efforts where potential future business is uncertain; wholesale and retail competition including alternative energy sources, growth in customer-owned power resource technologies that displace utility-supplied energy or that may be sold back to the utility, and alternative energy suppliers and delivery arrangements;

the potential effects of initiatives, legislation or administrative rulemaking at the federal, state or local levels, including possible effects on our generating resources, prohibitions or restrictions on new or existing services, or restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate concerns over global climate changes, including future limitations on the usage and distribution of natural gas; political pressures or regulatory practices that could constrain or place additional cost burdens on our distribution systems through accelerated adoption of distributed generation or electric-powered transportation or on our energy supply sources, such as campaigns to halt fossil fuel-fired power generation and opposition to other thermal generation, wind turbines or hydroelectric facilities; failure to identify changes in legislation, taxation and regulatory issues that could be detrimental or beneficial to our overall business; policy and/or legislative changes in various regulated areas, including, but not limited to, environmental regulation, healthcare regulations and import/export regulations;\n\nFinancial Risk\n\nweather conditions, which affect both energy demand and electric generating capability, including the impact of precipitation and temperature on hydroelectric resources, the impact of wind patterns on wind-generated power, weather-sensitive customer demand, and similar impacts on supply and demand in the wholesale energy markets;

      "title": "Charles River Laboratories Announces Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Results and Provides 2023 Guidance",
      "content": "– Fourth-Quarter Revenue of $1.10 Billion and Full-Year Revenue of $3.98 Billion –\n\n– Fourth-Quarter GAAP Earnings per Share of $3.65 and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share of $2.98 –\n\n– Full-Year GAAP Earnings per Share of $9.48 and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share of $11.12 –\n\n– Provides 2023 Guidance –\n\nWILMINGTON, Mass., February 22, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (NYSE: CRL) today reported its results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 and provided guidance for 2023. For the quarter, revenue was $1.10 billion, an increase of 21.5% from $905.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nThe addition of a 53rd week at the end of 2022, which is periodically required to align to a December 31st calendar year end, contributed approximately 5.8% to reported fourth-quarter revenue growth. The acquisition of Explora BioLabs in April 2022 contributed 1.8% to consolidated fourth-quarter revenue growth, and the divestitures of the Research Models and Services operations in Japan (RMS Japan) and the CDMO site in Sweden (CDMO Sweden) in October 2021, and the Avian Vaccine business in December 2022, reduced reported revenue growth by 0.5%. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced reported revenue growth by 4.4%. Excluding the effect of these items, organic revenue growth was 18.8%, driven by contributions from all three business segments, primarily the Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) business segment.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders was $187.4 million, an increase of 36.2% from $137.6 million for the same period in 2021. Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $3.65, an increase of 36.7% from $2.67 for the fourth quarter of 2021. The increases in GAAP net income and earnings per share were primarily driven by a gain on the sale of the Avian Vaccine business.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income was $152.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 19.0% from $128.4 million for the same period in 2021. Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $2.98, an increase of 19.7% from $2.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The increases in non-GAAP net income and earnings per share were primarily driven by higher revenue and operating income.\n\nStory continues\n\nJames C. Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We are pleased with the outstanding finish to the year. We exceeded our expectations due primarily to another robust performance in the DSA segment, and quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time. We believe our 2022 performance demonstrates the strength of our business – including our leading market position, unique non-clinical focus, and the resilience of our large, diversified client base – as we meet the sustained pace of client demand despite the macroeconomic environment.\"\n\n\"At Charles River, we are committed to conducting ethical, regulatory-compliant business practices, to being good corporate citizens, and to the humane treatment of the research models under our care. 2023 presents challenges with respect to NHP supply that we will proactively manage; however, our business fundamentals remain solid and we will continue to benefit from the sustainable, long-term growth trends that are inherent in our business. We are focused on continuing to execute our strategy, drive growth and generate greater efficiency, and enhance our position as the scientific partner of choice to accelerate biomedical research and therapeutic innovation,\" Mr. Foster concluded.\n\nFourth-Quarter Segment Results\n\nResearch Models and Services (RMS)\n\nRevenue for the RMS segment was $196.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 18.4% from $165.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Explora BioLabs acquisition and the addition of the 53rd week contributed 10.1% and 4.5%, respectively, to RMS revenue growth in the quarter. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 5.2%, and the impact of the RMS Japan divestiture reduced revenue by 1.8%. Organic revenue growth of 10.8% was primarily driven by robust demand for research model services, particularly the Insourcing Solutions (IS) business, as well as higher revenue for small research models in North America and China.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the RMS segment’s GAAP operating margin decreased to 18.9% from 24.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and on a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 22.7% from 26.9%. The GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreases were driven primarily by the addition of the 53rd week, lower revenue in the Cell Solutions business, and a modest COVID-related impact in China.\n\nDiscovery and Safety Assessment (DSA)\n\nRevenue for the DSA segment was $691.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 29.5% from $534.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The addition of the 53rd week contributed 6.9% to reported DSA revenue growth, and the impact of foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 3.9%. Organic revenue growth of 26.5% was driven principally by broad-based growth in the Safety Assessment business, resulting from higher study volume and meaningful price increases, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The Discovery Services revenue growth rate also increased on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the DSA segment’s GAAP operating margin increased to 22.7% from 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and on a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin increased to 26.3% from 23.1%. The GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin increases were driven primarily by higher revenue in the Safety Assessment business.\n\nManufacturing Solutions (Manufacturing)\n\nRevenue for the Manufacturing segment was $212.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 3.3% from $205.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The addition of the 53rd week contributed 4.0% to reported Manufacturing revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 4.8%, and the impact of the CDMO Sweden and Avian Vaccine divestitures reduced revenue by 1.2%. Organic revenue growth of 5.3% was driven primarily by robust demand in the Biologics Testing Solutions and Microbial Solutions businesses, partially offset by a revenue decline in the CDMO business.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Manufacturing segment’s GAAP operating margin decreased to 12.6% from 44.6% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and on a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 25.3% from 35.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins primarily declined as a result of lower revenue in the CDMO businesses. The GAAP operating margin also decreased due to an acquisition-related adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2021 associated with a contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nFull-Year Results\n\nFor 2022, revenue increased by 12.3% to $3.98 billion from $3.54 billion in 2021. Organic revenue growth was 13.4%.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net income attributable to common shareholders was $486.2 million in 2022, an increase of 24.4% from $391.0 million in 2021. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in 2022 were $9.48, an increase of 24.7% from $7.60 in 2021.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income was $570.6 million in 2022, an increase of 7.6% from $530.5 million in 2021. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis in 2022 were $11.12, an increase of 7.8% from $10.32 in 2021.\n\nResearch Models and Services (RMS)\n\nFor 2022, RMS revenue was $739.2 million, an increase of 7.1% from $690.4 million in 2021. Organic revenue growth increased 9.0%.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, the RMS segment operating margin decreased to 21.7% in 2022 from 24.2% in 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 25.2% in 2022 from 27.3% in 2021.\n\nDiscovery and Safety Assessment (DSA)\n\nFor 2022, DSA revenue was $2.45 billion, an increase of 16.1% from $2.11 billion in 2021. Organic revenue growth was 17.5%.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, the DSA segment operating margin increased to 21.8% in 2022 from 19.3% in 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin increased to 25.3% in 2022 from 23.7% in 2021.\n\nManufacturing Solutions (Manufacturing)\n\nFor 2022, Manufacturing revenue was $789.6 million, an increase of 6.3% from $742.5 million in 2021. Organic revenue growth was 5.3%.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, the Manufacturing segment operating margin decreased to 21.2% in 2022 from 33.2% in 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin decreased to 28.8% in 2022 from 34.2% in 2021.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice Investigation into Non-Human Primate Supply Chain\n\nOn February 17th, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice relating to an investigation into the Cambodian non-human primate (NHP) supply chain. The Company has been informed that this investigation relates specifically to several shipments of NHPs received by Charles River from its Cambodian supplier. Charles River intends to fully cooperate with the U.S. government as part of their investigation. Due to ongoing investigations and the heightened focus on the Cambodian NHP supply chain in recent months, Charles River has voluntarily suspended NHP shipments from Cambodia at this time.\n\n2023 Guidance\n\nThe Company is providing financial guidance for 2023. The 2023 revenue growth outlook reflects the impact of NHP supply constraints, which is expected to reduce our consolidated revenue growth forecast by approximately 200 to 400 basis points this year. This will pressure the DSA segment’s revenue growth rate in 2023, while the Company expects higher growth in the Manufacturing segment as the actions to improve the performance of its CDMO business gain traction.\n\nEarnings per share in 2023 will be affected by the impact of NHP supply constraints. In addition, a higher tax rate, increased interest expense, and the impact of the divestiture of the Avian Vaccine business will reduce earnings per share by approximately $2.30 to $2.50 on a GAAP basis (including the gain on the sale of the Avian Vaccine business) and by approximately $1.20 to $1.40 on a non-GAAP basis in 2023. This will be partially offset by foreign exchange, which is projected to benefit reported revenue growth by up to 50 basis points and earnings per share by up to $0.25 in 2023 due to the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe Company’s 2023 guidance for revenue growth and earnings per share is as follows:\n\n2023 GUIDANCE Revenue growth, reported 1.5% – 4.5% Impact of divestitures/(acquisitions), net ~1.5% Impact of 53rd week in 2022 ~1.5% Unfavorable/(favorable) impact of foreign exchange 0.0% - (0.5)% Revenue growth, organic (1) 4.5% – 7.5% GAAP EPS estimate (2) $7.40 – $8.60 Acquisition-related amortization ~$2.00 Acquisition and integration-related adjustments (3) ~$0.10 Other items (4) ~$0.20 Non-GAAP EPS estimate $9.70 – $10.90\n\nFootnotes to Guidance Table: (1) Organic revenue growth is defined as reported revenue growth adjusted for completed acquisitions and divestitures, the 53rd week in 2022, and foreign currency translation.\r\n(2) GAAP earnings per share does not include third-party legal costs and other costs related to investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into the Cambodian NHP supply chain because these costs are impractical to estimate at this time. Certain costs related to this investigation are expected to be excluded from non-GAAP results.\r\n(3) These adjustments are related to the evaluation and integration of acquisitions and divestitures, and primarily include transaction, advisory, certain third-party integration costs, and certain costs associated with acquisition-related efficiency initiatives.\r\n(4) These items primarily relate to charges associated with U.S. and international tax legislation that necessitated changes to the Company’s international financing structure; certain third-party legal costs related to (a) environmental litigation related to the Microbial Solutions business and (b) investigations by the U.S. government into the NHP supply chain applicable to our Safety Assessment business; and severance and other costs related to the Company’s efficiency initiatives.\n\nWebcast\n\nCharles River has scheduled a live webcast on Wednesday, February 22nd, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss matters relating to this press release. To participate, please go to ir.criver.com and select the webcast link. You can also find the associated slide presentation and reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures on the website.\n\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\n\nThe Company reports non-GAAP results in this press release, which exclude often-one-time charges and other items that are outside of normal operations. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the schedules at the end of this press release.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude, but are not limited to, the amortization of intangible assets, and other charges and adjustments related to our acquisitions and divestitures, including the gain on our sale of our Avian Vaccine business; expenses associated with evaluating and integrating acquisitions and divestitures, including advisory fees and certain other transaction-related costs, as well as fair value adjustments associated with contingent consideration; charges, gains, and losses attributable to businesses or properties we plan to close, consolidate, or divest; severance and other costs associated with our efficiency initiatives; the write-off of deferred financing costs and fees related to debt financing; investment gains or losses associated with our venture capital and other strategic equity investments; certain legal costs in our Microbial Solutions business related to environmental litigation and in our Safety Assessment business related to U.S. government investigations into the NHP supply chain; and adjustments related to the recognition of deferred tax assets expected to be utilized as a result of changes to the our international financing structure and the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities as a result of foreign tax legislation. This press release also refers to our revenue on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis: \"organic revenue growth,\" which we define as reported revenue growth adjusted for foreign currency translation, acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of the 53rd week in 2022. We exclude these items from the non-GAAP financial measures because they are outside our normal operations. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures, as they are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In particular, we believe that the inclusion of supplementary non-GAAP financial measures in this press release helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results and future prospects without the effect of these often-one-time charges, and is consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to prior periods or forecasts. We believe that the financial impact of our acquisitions and divestitures (and in certain cases, the evaluation of such acquisitions and divestitures, whether or not ultimately consummated) is often large relative to our overall financial performance, which can adversely affect the comparability of our results on a period-to-period basis. In addition, certain activities and their underlying associated costs, such as business acquisitions, generally occur periodically but on an unpredictable basis. We calculate non-GAAP integration costs to include third-party integration costs incurred post-acquisition. Presenting revenue on an organic basis allows investors to measure our revenue growth exclusive of acquisitions, divestitures, the 53rd week in 2022, and foreign currency exchange fluctuations more clearly. Non-GAAP results also allow investors to compare the Company’s operations against the financial results of other companies in the industry who similarly provide non-GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company intends to continue to assess the potential value of reporting non-GAAP results consistent with applicable rules and regulations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in this press release, and can also be found on the Company’s website at ir.criver.com.\n\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"may,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"outlook,\" and \"project,\" and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These statements also include statements regarding Charles River’s expectations regarding the availability of Cambodia-sourced NHPs; the impact of the investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into the Cambodia NHP supply chain, including but not limited to Charles River’s ability to cooperate fully with the U.S. government; Charles River’s ability to effectively manage any Cambodia NHP supply impact; the projected future financial performance of Charles River and our specific businesses, including our expectations with respect to the impact of NHP supply constraints; earnings per share; client demand, particularly the future demand for drug discovery and development products and services, including our expectations for future revenue trends; our expectations with respect to pricing of our products and services; our expectations with respect to future tax rates and the impact of such tax rates on our business; our expectations with respect to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures completed in 2021 and 2022 on the Company, our service offerings, client perception, strategic relationships, revenue, revenue growth rates, revenue growth drivers, and earnings; the development and performance of our services and products, including our investments in our portfolio; market and industry conditions including the outsourcing of services and spending trends by our clients; and Charles River’s future performance as delineated in our forward-looking guidance, and particularly our expectations with respect to revenue, the impact of foreign exchange, interest rates, enhanced efficiency initiatives, and the assumptions surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that form the basis for our annual guidance. Forward-looking statements are based on Charles River’s current expectations and beliefs, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by the forward-looking statements.

We believe that our market leadership and financial strength will allow us to navigate through this uncertain period, continue to broaden our partner base, and position us to capitalize on increased consumer demand when the current macroeconomic headwinds subside.\"\n\nConsolidated Results\n\nConsolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $612.1 million, a decrease of 5.3% from the same period in 2021, with the impact of lower approval rates and weak retail traffic partially offset by an increase in average ticket size, further penetration with large national retail partners, and additional e-commerce integrations.\n\nThe Company reported consolidated net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $36.1 million, compared with $37.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $74.4 million, or 12.2% of revenues, compared with $72.1 million, or 11.2% of revenues for the same period in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe year over year growth in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by strong portfolio performance and cost disciplines instituted mid-year to adjust for the anticipated decline in revenue.\n\nDiluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $0.73 compared with $0.59 in the year ago period. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.84 in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $0.67 for the same quarter in 2021. Our weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution in the fourth quarter was 22.9% lower than the same quarter in 2021.\n\nProgressive Leasing Results\n\nProgressive Leasing's fourth quarter GMV decreased 14.8% to $540.9 million compared with the same period in 2021, primarily due to tighter decisioning on lease approvals and weaker traffic patterns for our retail partners, both in store and online. E-commerce GMV within the segment decreased 4.4% year-over-year; however, it increased to 20.4% of the segment's total GMV in the fourth quarter of 2022. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs was 6.5% of lease revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022, down both sequentially and year-over-year. We continued to see improved delinquency trends within the quarter following the tightening in decisioning made earlier in the year.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Allocation\n\nPROG Holdings ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with cash of $131.9 million and gross debt of $600 million. The Company repurchased $36.2 million of its stock in the quarter at an average price of $17.83 per share and has $337.3 million remaining under its previously-announced $1 billion share repurchase program.\n\n2023 Outlook\n\nThe Company is issuing full year and Q1 2023 outlook for revenues, net earnings, adjusted EBITDA, GAAP diluted EPS, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. This outlook assumes a difficult operating environment with continued soft demand for consumer durable goods, no material changes in the Company's decisioning posture, and no impact from additional share repurchases.\n\nFull Year 2023 Outlook (In thousands, except per share amounts) Low High PROG Holdings - Total Revenues $ 2,340,000 $ 2,440,000 PROG Holdings - Net Earnings 82,500 103,500 PROG Holdings - Adjusted EBITDA 215,000 245,000 PROG Holdings - Diluted EPS 1.69 2.12 PROG Holdings - Diluted Non-GAAP EPS 2.11 2.54 Progressive Leasing - Total Revenues 2,275,000 2,370,000 Progressive Leasing - Earnings Before Taxes 147,000 167,000 Progressive Leasing - Adjusted EBITDA 228,000 251,000 Vive - Total Revenues 65,000 70,000 Vive - Earnings Before Taxes 2,500 4,500 Vive - Adjusted EBITDA 5,000 8,000 Other - Loss Before Taxes (26,000 ) (23,000 ) Other - Adjusted EBITDA (18,000 ) (14,000 )\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023\r\nOutlook (In thousands, except per share amounts) Low High PROG Holdings - Total Revenues $ 635,000 $ 660,000 PROG Holdings - Net Earnings 34,500 37,500 PROG Holdings - Adjusted EBITDA 72,000 77,000 PROG Holdings - Diluted EPS 0.71 0.77 PROG Holdings - Diluted Non-GAAP EPS 0.82 0.88\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nThe Company has scheduled a live webcast and conference call for Wednesday, February 22nd, 2023, at 8:30 A.M.

Such forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"outlook\" and similar forward-looking terminology. These risks and uncertainties include factors such as (i) continued volatility and challenges in the macro environment and, in particular, the unfavorable effects on our business of the rapid increase in the rate of inflation currently being experienced in the economy, which has not been seen in more than forty years, significant increases in interest rates, and fears of a recession, and the impact of those headwinds on: (a) consumer confidence and customer demand for the merchandise that our POS partners sell; (b) our customers’ disposable income and their ability to make the lease and loan payments they owe the company; (c) the availability of consumer credit; (d) our labor costs; and (e) our overall financial performance and outlook; (ii) our businesses being subject to extensive laws and regulations, including laws and regulations unique to the industries in which our businesses operate, that may subject them to government investigations and significant monetary penalties and compliance-related burdens, as well as an increased focus by federal, state and local regulators on the industries within which our businesses operate, including with respect to consumer protection, customer privacy, third party and employee fraud and information security; (iii) deteriorating macroeconomic conditions resulting in the algorithms and other proprietary decisioning tools used in approving Progressive Leasing and Vive customers for leases and loans no longer being indicative of their ability to perform, which may limit the ability of those businesses to avoid lease and loan charge-offs or may result in their reserves being insufficient to cover actual losses; (iv) a large percentage of the company’s revenues being concentrated with several of Progressive Leasing’s key POS partners; (v) the risks that Progressive Leasing will be unable to attract new POS partners or retain and grow its business with its existing POS partners; (vi) Vive’s and Four’s business models differing significantly from Progressive Leasing’s, which creates specific and unique risks for the Vive and Four businesses, including Vive’s reliance on two bank partners to issue its credit products and Vive’s and Four’s exposure to the unique regulatory risks associated with the laws and regulations that apply to their businesses; (vii) the risks that interruptions, inventory shortages and other factors affecting the supply chains of our retail partners having a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance; (viii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including new variants, subvariants or additional waves of COVID-19 infections, on: (a) demand for the lease-to-own products offered by our Progressive Leasing segment, (b) Progressive Leasing’s point-of-sale or \"POS\" partners, and Vive’s and Four’s merchant partners, (c) Progressive Leasing’s, Vive’s and Four’s customers, including their ability and willingness to satisfy their obligations under their lease agreements and loan agreements, (d) Progressive Leasing’s POS partners being able to obtain the merchandise their customers need or desire, (e) our employees and labor needs, including our ability to adequately staff our operations, (f) our financial and operational performance, and (g) our liquidity; (iv) changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations and the adoption of new laws and regulations that may unfavorably impact our businesses; (ix) the risk that our capital allocation strategy, including our current share repurchase program, will not be effective at enhancing shareholder value; (x) our cost reduction initiatives may not be adequate or may have unintended consequences that could be disruptive to our businesses; (xi) the loss of the services of our key executives or our inability to attract and retain key talent, particularly with respect to our information technology function, may have a material adverse impact on our operations; (xii) increased competition from traditional and virtual lease-to-own competitors and also from competitors of our Vive segment; (xiii) adverse consequences to Progressive Leasing, including additional monetary penalties and/or injunctive relief, if it fails to comply with the terms of its 2020 settlement with the FTC, as well as the possibility of other regulatory authorities and third parties bringing legal actions against Progressive Leasing based on the same allegations that led to the FTC settlement; (xiv) our increased level of indebtedness; (xv) our ability to protect confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information, including the personal and confidential information of our customers, which may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, employee or other internal misconduct, computer viruses, electronic break-ins or \"hacking,\" or similar disruptions, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects; and (xvi) the other risks and uncertainties discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023. Statements in this press release that are \"forward-looking\" include without limitation statements about: (i) the benefits we expect to realize from our market leadership and financial strength, including our ability to broaden our base of POS partners and to capitalize on increased consumer demand when the current macroeconomic headwinds subside; and (ii) our full-year and first-quarter 2023 outlook.

      "content": "Berry Corporation (Bry)\n\nDALLAS, Feb. 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berry Corporation (bry) (NASDAQ: BRY) (“Berry” or the “Company”) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results. For the fourth quarter Berry’s net income was $72 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, and Adjusted Net Income(1) was $76 million, or $0.95 per diluted share. For the full year Berry's net income was $250 million, or $3.03 per diluted share, Adjusted Net Income(1) was $226 million, or $2.74 per diluted share, and cash flows from operating activities were $361 million.\n\n2022 Highlights\n\nDelivered record $189 million of shareholder returns, consisting of:\n\n$1.78 per share fixed and variable dividends (inclusive of dividends to be paid in March 2023) and Five million shares repurchased, or 7% of current shares outstanding Produced net income of $250 million and Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $380 million Generated cash flows from operating activities of $361 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow(1) of $200 million Increased proved reserves to 110 million boe, achieved reserve replacement of 236%, primarily through field extensions Announced doubling the fixed dividend to $0.48 per share annually beginning with the first quarter 2023 Increased authorization of share repurchases to $200 million\n\n__________\n\n(1) Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” later in this press release for a reconciliation and more information on these Non-GAAP measures.\n\n“2022 was a good year for Berry both financially and operationally. Once again, we showed the incredible quality of our assets and our ability to navigate the California regulatory environment by holding production flat in the state, net of prior year divestitures. We believe the quality of our assets gives us a competitive advantage over other energy companies. We have decline curves in the low teens, and we achieved 94% of our total annual production from our existing wells, or our base production, in 2022. We are proud to have returned $189 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is roughly 27% of our current market capitalization returned in just one year. Our unique assets and operating model generated strong free cash flow which, when allocated in accordance with our shareholder return model, delivered industry leading returns to our shareholders,” said Fernando Araujo, Berry CEO.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Reflecting the confidence we have in our business plan and strategy, we are doubling our quarterly fixed dividend in 2023. Our goal is to continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flow and return it to shareholders, further proving the quality of our assets and our ability to efficiently manage the business,” continued Araujo.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Results\n\nNet income was $72 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $78 million in the fourth quarter 2022 compared to $192 million and $97 million, respectively, in the third quarter. This decrease is primarily due to lower commodity prices resulting in lower revenue, higher purchased fuel costs and higher greenhouse gas (“GHG”) costs.\n\nThe Company's average daily production in the fourth quarter 2022 of 25,800 boe/d was flat compared to third quarter volumes. Company-wide oil production in the fourth quarter 2022 increased 2% sequentially and California production, which consists solely of oil and comprises 82% of total company production, increased 1% to 21,100 mboe/d in the fourth quarter.\n\nCompany-wide realized oil price, including hedging effects, were $73.39 per bbl for the fourth quarter 2022 compared to $76.41 per bbl in the third quarter. Excluding hedging effects, California's average realized oil prices were $81.66 per bbl in the fourth quarter, 92% of Brent, and $91.67 per bbl in the third quarter, 94% of Brent.\n\nLease operating expenses, which includes fuel gas costs for our California steam operations, increased 11% in the fourth quarter 2022 from the third quarter due to higher natural gas purchase prices. Natural gas average purchase price increased 18% from the third quarter.\n\nTaxes, other than income taxes increased 95% in the fourth quarter 2022 from the third quarter due to higher GHG mark-to-market prices and higher property taxes.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased 15% in the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the third quarter, almost entirely due to executive transition costs. Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses(1), which excludes non-cash stock compensation costs and non-recurring costs, remained flat quarter over quarter.\n\nThe net income for the well servicing and abandonment business, C&J Well Services, improved 27% to $6.6 million in the fourth quarter 2022 compared to $5.2 million in the third quarter, due to improved margins.\n\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, capital expenditures were approximately $45 million, excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligation spending and well servicing and abandonment capital of $5 million. This was an increase compared to $41 million for the third quarter reflecting California development activity late into the year. Additionally, Berry spent approximately $4 million for plugging and abandonment activities in the fourth quarter.\n\nFull-Year 2022 Results\n\nNet income was $250 million in 2022 compared to a net loss of $16 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $380 million in 2022 compared to $212 million in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher oil and gas realized prices and lower GHG costs, partially offset by higher purchased fuel costs, other non-fuel lease operating expenses, and general and administrative expenses.\n\nThe decrease in the Company's average daily production for the full year 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by the divestitures made in late 2021 (California) and early 2022 (Colorado), partially offset by the Utah Antelope Creek acquisition in early 2022. California production, net of the 2021 divestiture, production was flat year-over-year despite significant challenges in receiving new drill permits which forced a mid-year capital allocation pivot to increased sidetrack, workover and recompletion activity. Utah production in 2022 increased 12% compared to 2021 due to new drilling activity and the Antelope Creek acquisition, which more than offset natural decline.\n\nCompany-wide realized oil prices, including hedging effects, were $77.59 per bbl in 2022 compared to $50.12 per bbl in 2021. Excluding hedging effects, California average realized oil prices were $93.40 per bbl, 94% of Brent in 2022 and $67.27 per bbl in 2021, 95% of Brent.\n\nLease operating expenses, which includes fuel costs for our California steam operations, increased 28% due to higher prices associated with purchased fuel, well servicing and workover costs, outside services, chemicals, power, and other inflationary impacts. Natural gas average purchase price increased 39% from 2021. Natural gas prices also impact electricity generation expense.\n\nThe divestitures made in late 2021 (California) and early 2022 (Colorado) also decreased other expenses and revenues related to our field operations, including for electricity, marketing and transportation activities. In particular, the majority of our marketing expenses and revenues were related to our Colorado operations, which were sold in early 2022.\n\nTaxes, other than income taxes, decreased 15% in 2022 compared to 2021, largely due to the California divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2021, which lowered GHG emissions, as well as lower GHG mark-to-market prices in 2022 on remaining operations.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased 32% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a full year of expense for the well servicing and abandonment business, employee cost inflation, including non-cash stock compensation costs and higher professional services costs. Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, which excludes non-cash stock compensation costs and non-recurring costs, increased for largely the same reasons.\n\nThe well servicing and abandonment business results of operations were included in the Company's consolidated results beginning on the October 1, 2021 acquisition date. The full year 2022 results for this business include services revenues of $181 million, costs of services of $143 million, general and administrative expenses of $13 million, net income before income taxes of $15 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $26 million.\n\nCapital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligation spending totaled $145 million for 2022 (excluding well servicing and abandonment capital of $8 million) compared to $132 million for 2021. The Company’s increased 2022 capital program compared to 2021 was in response to the improved oil price environment and the improving global and national economic environment. The Company allocated more capital to the Utah assets in 2022, compared to 2021, in part due to the opportunities in the newly acquired Antelope Creek properties. As a result of the significant challenges in receiving new drill permits in California, the Company drilled fewer new wells and increased the sidetrack, workover and recompletion activity in California compared to the prior year. The increase in full-year capital expenditures is also partially due to cost inflation in excess of our initial expectations, which we began to experience mid-year. Additionally, Berry spent $20 million in 2022 on plugging and abandonment activities.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had liquidity of $252 million, consisting of $46 million cash and $206 million available for borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facilities.\n\nProved reserves were 110 mmboe on December 31, 2022, of which 76% are located in California, which is also where 85% of the PV-10(1) value is located. In 2022, Berry achieved a reserve replacement of 236%, primarily from field extensions.\n\nMike Helm, Berry's Chief Financial Officer stated, “Looking ahead to 2023, our core strategy of delivering substantial shareholder returns has not changed. We are modifying our shareholder return model allocation, with the goal of increasing the value of our shares and lowering our cost of capital. Our strategy includes doubling our fixed dividends, currently planned at $0.48 per share annually. Additionally, we intend to allocate 80% of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow primarily to share repurchases and debt repurchases, while the remaining 20% will be allocated to variable dividends. Based on current prices and outlook, we are now targeting a high single-digit dividend yield, combining the fixed and variable dividends. We have crafted a capital program for 2023 that is designed to support these goals by optimizing our production and driving cost efficiencies. Berry’s focus is on maximizing shareholder value through our shareholder return model and managing what we are able to control.”\n\n__________\n\n(1) Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” later in this press release for a reconciliation and more information on these Non-GAAP measures.\n\nQuarterly Dividend\n\nIn February 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $0.50 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock, comprising a fixed dividend of $0.06 per share and a variable dividend of $0.44 per share, based on fourth quarter 2022 Adjusted Free Cash Flow in accordance with the Company’s shareholder return model. Both dividends are payable on March 23, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2023. Cash dividends attributable to 2022 totaled $1.78 per share, as noted in the table below.\n\n2022 Dividends\n\nFirst Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Year-to-Date Fixed Dividends $ 0.06 $ 0.06 $ 0.06 $ 0.06 $ 0.24 Variable Dividends(1) 0.13 0.56 0.41 0.44 1.54 Total $ 0.19 $ 0.62 $ 0.47 $ 0.50 $ 1.78\n\n_______\n\n(1) Variable Dividends are declared the quarter following the period of results (the period used to determine the variable divided based on the shareholder return model). The table notes total dividends earned in each quarter.\n\nGoing forward, subject to declaration by the Board, the Company intends to double the fixed dividend to $0.12 per share quarterly or $0.48 per share annually; variable dividends will be paid in accordance with its shareholder return model.\n\nUpdated Shareholder Return Model (SRM)\n\nBeginning with first quarter 2023 results, in accordance with the updated shareholder return model, Berry plans to allocate Adjusted Free Cash Flow as follows:\n\n80% primarily to share repurchases and debt repurchases, and 20% to variable dividends.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance, and it should not be inferred that the entire amount of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is available for variable dividends, debt or share repurchases or other discretionary expenditures, since we have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure and would be paid out of the 80% bucket, as necessary.\n\nThe Board also increased the authorization for share repurchases to $200 million. The Board had previously authorized $75 million of debt repurchases all of which remains available.\n\nFull-Year 2023 Guidance\n\nBerry’s 2023 capital program reflects management’s prior experience with the constraints imposed by the current permitting environment impacting Kern County, with an underlying commitment to maximize Adjusted Free Cash Flow to return to shareholders. Accordingly, our current plan contemplates a slight decline in annual production year-over-year, primarily due to anticipated delays in the receipt of new drill permits. In sum, Berry’s current capital program for 2023 focuses on workovers and other activities related to existing wellbores, as well as a limited number of new wells for which we already have permits in hand. The Company still, however, expects to be able to generate significant Adjusted Free Cash Flow in 2023, based on current strip pricing. For the avoidance of doubt, the expected sequential year over year decline in Adjusted Free Cash Flow is almost exclusively due to lower commodity price assumptions.\n\nThe Company has oil hedges for approximately three-quarters of its expected 2023 oil production at about $77 per barrel Brent and gas hedges for approximately three-quarters of its expected 2023 gas purchases at about $5.40 per mmbtu.\n\nFull-Year 2023 Guidance  Low High Average Daily Production (boe/d)(1) 24,000 25,200 Expenses from field operations ($/boe)(2) $35.00 $37.00 E&P non-production revenues ($/boe)(3) $3.30 $3.50 Natural gas purchase hedge settlements ($/boe)(4)(5) (3.60) (3.85) Taxes, Other than Income Taxes ($/boe) $4.75 $5.25 Adjusted General & Administrative (G&A) expenses ($/boe)(6)(7) E&P Segment & Corp $6.55 $6.95 Well Servicing and Abandonment Segment ~$1.55 Capital Expenditures ($ millions) E&P Segment & Corp $95 $105 Well Servicing and Abandonment Segment ~$8 Well Servicing & Abandonment Segment Adjusted EBITDA ($mm) ~$27\n\n__________\n\n(1) Oil production is expected to be approximately 92% of total. (2) Expenses from field operations include lease operating expenses, electricity generation expenses, transportation expense, and marketing expenses. (3) E&P non-production revenues include sales from electricity, transportation, and marketing activities. (4) Natural gas purchase hedge settlements is the cash (received) or paid from these derivatives on a per boe basis. (5) Based on natural gas hedge positions and basis differentials as of February 1, 2023, and the Henry Hub gas price of $3.75 per mmbtu. (6) Adjusted General & Administrative expenses and Well Servicing and Abandonment Segment Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of these measures because the Company believes such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items included in or excluded from the GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Non-GAAP forward-looking measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

Overall, management assesses the efficiency of our E&P field operations by considering core E&P operating expenses together with our cogeneration, marketing and transportation activities. In particular, a core component of our E&P operations in California is steam, which we use to lift heavy oil to the surface. We operate several cogeneration facilities to produce some of the steam needed in our operations. In comparing the cost effectiveness of our cogeneration plants against other sources of steam in our operations, management considers the cost of operating the cogeneration plants, including the cost of the natural gas purchased to operate the facilities, against the value of the steam and electricity used in our E&P field operations and the revenues we receive from sales of excess electricity to the grid. We strive to minimize the variability of our fuel gas costs for our California steam operations with natural gas purchase hedges. Consequently, the efficiency of our E&P field operations are impacted by the cash settlements we receive or pay from these derivatives. We also have contracts for the transportation of fuel gas from the Rockies which has historically been cheaper than the California markets. With respect to transportation and marketing, management also considers opportunistic sales of incremental capacity in assessing the overall efficiencies of E&P operations.\n\nLease operating expenses include fuel, labor, field office, vehicle, supervision, maintenance, tools and supplies, and workover expenses. Electricity generation expenses include the portion of fuel, labor, maintenance, and tools and supplies from two of our cogeneration facilities allocated to electricity generation expense; the remaining cogeneration expenses are included in lease operating expense. Transportation expenses relate to our costs to transport the oil and gas that we produce within our properties or move it to the market. Marketing expenses mainly relate to natural gas purchased from third parties that moves through our gathering and processing systems and then is sold to third parties. Electricity revenue is from the sale of excess electricity from two of our cogeneration facilities to a California utility company under long-term contracts at market prices. These cogeneration facilities are sized to satisfy the steam needs in their respective fields, but the corresponding electricity produced is more than the electricity that is currently required for the operations in those fields. Transportation sales relate to water and other liquids that we transport on our systems on behalf of third parties and marketing revenues represent sales of natural gas purchased from and sold to third parties.\n\nEarnings Conference Call\n\nCall Date: Wednesday, February 22, 2023\n\nCall Time: 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 10:00 a.m. Central Time / 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time\n\nJoin the live listen-only audio webcast at https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/wjwwahmj or at https://bry.com/category/events\n\nIf you would like to ask a question on the live call, please preregister at any time using the following link:\r\nhttps://register.vevent.com/register/BIc62dbff31cac400faf92dc1624074392\n\nOnce registered, you will receive the dial-in numbers and a unique PIN number.

(2) Northwest, Rocky Mountains and Henry Hub are the relevant indices used for gas sales and purchases in the Rockies.\n\nNatural gas prices and differentials are strongly affected by local market fundamentals, availability of transportation capacity from producing areas and seasonal impacts. Our key exposure to gas prices is in our costs. We purchase substantially more natural gas for our California steamfloods and cogeneration facilities than we produce and sell in the Rockies. In May 2022, we began purchasing most of our gas in the Rockies and transporting it to our California operations using our Kern River pipeline capacity. In 2022, we purchased approximately 60,000 mmbtu/d, of which 12,000 mmbtu/d was purchased in California beginning when we entered into the Kern River pipeline capacity agreement for 48,000 mmbtu/d. The natural gas we purchase in the Rockies is shipped to our operations in California to help limit our exposure to California fuel gas purchase price fluctuations. We strive to further minimize the variability of our fuel gas costs for our steam operations by hedging a significant portion of gas purchases. Additionally, the negative impact of higher gas prices on our California operating expenses is partially offset by higher gas sales for the gas we produce and sell in the Rockies.\n\nCURRENT HEDGING SUMMARY\n\nAs of January 31, 2023, we had the following crude oil production and gas purchases hedges.\n\nQ1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026 Brent Swaps Hedged volume (bbls) 1,385,278 1,387,750 1,211,717 1,196,000 3,392,048 — — Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $ 77.15 $ 77.01 $ 76.26 $ 76.18 $ 76.12 $ — $ — Put Spreads Hedged volume (bbls) 540,000 546,000 552,000 552,000 1,281,000 — — Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $50.00/$40.00 $50.00/$40.00 $50.00/$40.00 $50.00/$40.00 $50.00/$40.00 $ — $ — Producer Collars Hedged volume (bbls) 360,000 364,000 368,000 368,000 1,098,000 2,486,127 472,500 Weighted-average price ($/bbl) $40.00/$106.00 $40.00/$106.00 $40.00/$106.00 $40.00/$106.00 $40.00/$105.00 $58.53/$91.11 $60.00/$82.21 Henry Hub - Natural Gas purchases Consumer Collars Hedged volume (mmbtu) 2,110,000 1,820,000 — — — — — Weighted-average price ($/mmbtu) $4.00/$2.75 $4.00/$2.75 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — NWPL - Natural Gas purchases Swaps Hedged volume (mmbtu) 1,800,000 3,640,000 3,680,000 3,680,000 7,320,000 6,080,000 — Weighted-average price ($/mmbtu) $ 6.40 $ 5.34 $ 5.34 $ 5.34 $ 4.27 $ 4.27 $ — Gas Basis Differentials NWPL/HH - Natural Gas Purchases Hedged volume (mmbtu) 1,180,000 — — 610,000 — — — Weighted-average price ($/mmbtu) $ 1.12 $ — $ — $ 1.12 $ — $ — $ —\n\nE&P FIELD OPERATIONS\n\nQuarter Ended\r\nDecember 31,\r\n2022 Quarter Ended\r\nSeptember 30,\r\n2022 Quarter Ended\r\nDecember 31,\r\n2021 Year Ended\r\nDecember 31,\r\n2022 Year Ended\r\nDecember 31,\r\n2021 (unaudited)\r\n($ in per boe amounts) Expenses from field operations Lease operating expenses $ 36.95 $ 33.40 $ 26.23 $ 31.72 $ 23.60 Electricity generation expenses 2.19 2.56 1.43 2.29 2.31 Transportation expenses 0.43 0.54 0.69 0.48 0.69 Marketing expenses — — 0.32 0.03 0.38 Total $ 39.57 $ 36.50 $ 28.67 $ 34.52 $ 26.98 Cash settlements received for gas purchase hedges $ (5.28 ) $ (5.82 ) $ (3.37 ) $ (4.00 ) $ (5.09 ) E&P non-production revenues Electricity sales $ 3.49 $ 4.10 $ 2.46 $ 3.24 $ 3.56 Transportation sales 0.02 0.12 0.05 0.05 0.05 Marketing revenue — — 0.33 0.03 0.39 Total $ 3.51 $ 4.22 $ 2.84 $ 3.32",

I am very proud of what we accomplished in 2022 and look forward to the opportunities and challenges ahead.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFitness:\n\nRevenue from the fitness segment decreased 28% in the fourth quarter, with declines across all categories. Gross and operating margins were 49% and 12%, respectively, resulting in $40 million of operating income. During the quarter, we launched Bounce, our first LTE-connected kids smartwatch. Bounce offers two-way text and voice messaging, as well as real-time location tracking. Bounce also offers kids fitness tracking, games, and allows parents to assign chores and give rewards.\n\nOutdoor:\n\nRevenue from the outdoor segment grew 3% in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in handhelds and services. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 34%, respectively, resulting in $132 million of operating income. During the quarter, we launched the second-generation MARQ luxury smartwatch collection built with Grade-5 titanium, sapphire glass, and a vibrant AMOLED touchscreen display.\n\nAviation:\n\nRevenue from the aviation segment grew 27% in the fourth quarter with contributions from both the aftermarket and OEM categories. Gross and operating margins were 71% and 28%, respectively, resulting in $63 million of operating income. During the quarter, EASA approved the G5000® integrated retrofit flight deck in the Cessna Citation Excel and XLS. Also, we received Supplemental Type Certification by the Federal Aviation Administration for the GI 275 electronic flight instrument in the Dassault Falcon 7X business jet. In addition, during the quarter, we announced that L3Harris Technologies has chosen the G3000 tandem integrated flight deck as part of a U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Armed Overwatch program contract.\n\nMarine:\n\nRevenue from the marine segment grew 7% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by our sonar and chartplotter products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively, resulting in $43 million of operating income. During the quarter, we announced that Garmin Navionics®+ featuring a streamlined interface, combined coastal and inland content and access to daily chart updates with subscription is now pre-loaded in certain flagship GPSMAP® chartplotters. During the quarter, we received multiple accolades for advancing innovation and safety in the marine industry, including the prestigious IBEX Innovation Award, National Boating Industry Safety Award, and recognition as the Most Innovative Marine Company by Soundings Trade Only.\n\nAuto:\n\nRevenue from the auto segment decreased 14% during the fourth quarter as declines in our consumer products more than offset the growth in OEM programs. Gross margin was 39%, and we recorded an operating loss of $11 million in the quarter driven by ongoing investments in auto OEM programs. During the quarter, we were recognized by the BMW Group with a coveted 2022 Supplier Innovation Award in the customer experience category for contributions to the Theatre Screen in the all-new BMW 7 Series.\n\nChange in Operating Segments:\n\nIn January 2023, the Company combined the consumer auto operating segment with the outdoor operating segment. As a result, beginning with reports filed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company's operating segments will be fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, and auto OEM. Prior periods will be recast to conform to the revised composition (see Appendix A for the recast presentation).\n\nAdditional Financial Information:\n\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $478 million, a 5% increase over the prior year. Research and development increased 5% primarily due to engineering personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% driven primarily by personnel related expenses and information technology costs. Advertising expenses decreased 6% primarily due to lower cooperative advertising.\n\nThe effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 11.1%. Excluding $7 million of income tax expense due to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets associated with Switzerland tax reform transitional measures, our pro forma effective tax rate(1) in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 8.9% compared to 7.4% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits in the prior year related to a favorable adjustment of estimated quarterly taxes in fourth quarter of 2021 that were not repeated in the current year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated approximately $309 million of free cash flow(1). We continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a result of the additional week in the fourth quarter 2022, two quarterly dividends were paid totaling approximately $280 million and we repurchased approximately $93 million of Company stock. We have approximately $93 million remaining as of December 31, 2022 in the share repurchase program which is authorized through December 29, 2023.  We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.7 billion.\n\n(1) See attached Non-GAAP Financial Information for discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, including free cash flow.\n\n2023 Fiscal Year Guidance(2):\n\nWe expect full year 2023 revenue of approximately $5.00 billion, an increase of approximately 3% over 2022. We expect our full year pro forma EPS to be approximately $5.15 based upon gross margin of approximately 57.5%, operating margin of approximately 20.3% and pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 8.0%.\n\n2023 Guidance Revenue $5.00B Gross Margin 57.5 % Operating Margin 20.3 % Pro forma Effective Tax Rate 8.0 % Pro forma EPS $5.15\n\n(2) All amounts and %'s in the above 2023 Guidance table are approximate. Also, see attached discussion on Forward-looking Financial Measures.\n\nDividend Recommendation:\n\nThe board of directors intends to recommend to the shareholders for approval at the annual meeting to be held on June 9, 2023, a cash dividend in the amount of $2.92 per share (subject to possible adjustment based on the total amount of the dividend in Swiss Francs as approved at the annual meeting), payable in four equal installments on dates to be determined by the board. The board currently anticipates the scheduling of the dividend in four installments as follows:\n\nDividend Date Record Date Dividend Per Share June 30, 2023 June 20, 2023 $0.73 September 29, 2023 September 15, 2023 $0.73 December 29, 2023 December 15, 2023 $0.73 March 29, 2024 March 15, 2024 $0.73\n\nIn addition, the board has established March 31, 2023 as the payment date and March 15, 2023 as the record date for the final dividend installment of $0.73 per share, per the prior approval at the 2022 annual shareholders' meeting.

      "title": "SBA Communications (SBAC) Q4 AFFO Misses Estimates, Stock Down",
      "content": "Shares of SBA Communications Corporation SBAC lost 1.7% in after-hours trading following the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results. Quarterly adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $3.11 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.13. Nonetheless, this reflects a rise of 10.7% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nSBAC witnessed an improvement in site-leasing and site-development businesses, which supported the top line. It continues to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio.\r\n\r\nQuarterly total revenues increased 15.3% year over year to $686.1 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $681.8 million.\r\n\r\nPer Jeffrey Stoops, president and CEO of the company, “The US market remains active, with our largest US customers expected to all stay relatively busy with additional network deployment in 2023. We believe domestic activity will remain solid through 2023 and perhaps beyond, given the size and scope of our customers’ 5G deployment plans and our belief that much 5G work remains to be done on our assets.”\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nSite-leasing revenues were up 13% year over year to $609.6 million. This consisted of domestic site-leasing revenues of $452.9 million and international site-leasing revenues of $156.7 million. The domestic cash site-leasing revenues were $443 million, growing 5.1%. International cash site leasing revenues were $157.5 million, jumping 45.7%.\r\n\r\nSite-development revenues increased 36.9% to $76.5 million.\r\n\r\nThe site-leasing operating profit summed $494.6 million, marking an increase of 11.8%. Moreover, 96.3% of SBAC’s total operating profit in the quarter came from site leasing.\r\n\r\nThe overall operating income rose 18.9% to $234.7 million.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted EBITDA totaled $460.7 million, up 12.6%, while the adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 68.1% from 69.8% in the prior-year quarter.\n\nPortfolio Activity\n\nIn the October-December quarter, SBAC acquired 2,642 communication sites for total cash consideration of $736.7 million, including 2,632 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for roughly $725.0 million in cash. The company also built 162 towers during this period. It owned or operated 39,311 communication sites as of Dec 31, 2022, of which 17,416 were in the United States and its territories and 21,895 internationally.\r\n\r\nSBA Communications also spent $15.9 million to purchase land and easements and extend lease terms. Total cash capital expenditure was $823.5 million in the reported quarter, of which $13.8 million was non-discretionary and $809.7 million represented discretionary.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the quarter end, SBAC purchased or is under contract to buy 31 communication sites for a total consideration of $23.2 million in cash. It expects to complete the acquisition by the end of second-quarter 2023.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn the fourth quarter, SBA Communications generated $288.6 million of net cash from operating activities compared with the year-ago quarter’s $298.6 million.\r\n\r\nAs of Dec 31, 2022, it had $143.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from $367.3 million recorded at the end of December 2021. SBAC ended the quarter with net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6.9X.\r\n\r\nAs of Feb 20, 2023, the company had $585 million outstanding under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, SBAC did not repurchase any shares of its Class A common stock. As of Feb 20, 2023, it had $504.7 million of authorization remaining under its approved repurchase plan.\n\nUpbeat 2023 Outlook\n\nIt expects AFFO per share of $12.46-$12.83. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $12.75, which lies in the guided range.\r\n\r\nSite-leasing revenues are now projected to be $2,469-$2,489 million. Site-development revenues are expected to lie between $205 million and $225 million. The adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be in the band of $1,845-$1,865 million.\n\nDividend Update\n\nConcurrently, SBAC announced a cash dividend of 85 cents on its Class A common stock, representing a 20% hike from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid out on Mar 24 to shareholders on record as of Mar 10.\n\nSBA Communications Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SBA Communications Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nSBA Communications Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | SBA Communications Corporation Quote\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPerformance of Other REITs\n\nSITE Centers Corp. SITC reported fourth-quarter 2022 operating funds from operations (OFFO) per share of 29 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the figure was lower than the prior-year quarter’s 30 cents.\r\n\r\nSITC’s results reflect healthy leasing activity and a year-over-year improvement in annualized base rent.\r\n\r\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE reported fourth-quarter 2022 AFFO per share of $2.14, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The reported figure also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $1.97.\r\n\r\nARE’s results reflected decent leasing activity and rental rate growth during the quarter.\r\n\r\nNote: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has provided this non-GAAP financial information, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in this earnings release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release. The non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures in Guidance\n\nDriven Brands includes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS in the Company's Fiscal Year 2023 Guidance.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and have not been reconciled to the most comparable GAAP outlook because it is not possible to do so without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and potential variability of reconciling items, which are dependent on future events and often outside of management's control and which could be significant. Because such items cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide outlook for the comparable GAAP measures. Forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted herein and in our filings with the SEC.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\n\nAdjusted net income attributable to Driven Brands Holdings Inc. (\"Adjusted Net Income\") and Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Driven Brands common stockholders (\"Adjusted Earnings Per Share\") are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC's rules because they exclude certain amounts included in the net income attributable to Driven Brands common  stockholders and diluted earnings per share attributable to Driven Brands common stockholders calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are meaningful measures to share with investors because they facilitate comparison of the current period performance with that of the comparable prior period. In addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share afford investors a view of what management considers to be Driven Brands' core earnings performance as well as the ability to make a more informed assessment of such earnings performance with that of the prior period.\n\nThe tables below reflect the calculation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended (in thousands, except per share amounts) December 31, \r\n2022 December 25, \r\n2021 December 31, \r\n2022 December 25, \r\n2021 Net income (loss) $             27,398 $           (38,785) $            43,173 $               9,536 Acquisition related costs(a) 5,323 59,712 15,304 62,386",

      "content": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its “Baron Growth Fund” fourth quarter 2022 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the fourth quarter, the fund gained 11.93% (Institutional Shares) compared to a 4.13% return for the Russell 2000 Growth Index and a 7.56% return for the S&P 500 Index. Favorable stock selection led the fund to generate strong absolute and relative performance. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.\n\nBaron Growth Fund highlighted stocks like MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) in the Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in New York, New York, MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) is an investment decision support tools provider for clients. On February 21, 2023, MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) stock closed at $524.82 per share. One-month return of MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) was 3.18%, and its shares gained 3.03% of their value over the last 52 weeks. MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) has a market capitalization of $41.965 billion.\n\nBaron Growth Fund made the following comment about MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\"We believe that financial data and technology vendor MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) is an excellent example of the durability of recurring revenue and high retention rates across economic cycles. We estimate that approximately 97% of MSCI’s revenue comes from recurring sources. This includes 75% of revenue that comes from subscription contracts, which carry an average contract length that exceeds one year. This also includes approximately 22% of revenue from asset-based fees. Asset-based fees generate recurring revenue and are governed by multi-year contracts with the sponsor but can be impacted by fund flows and fluctuations in asset prices. Conversely, just 3% of MSCI’s revenue is non-recurring and needs to be resold in a future period.\n\nMSCI’s aggregate retention rate was 93.0% as of its most recently reported quarter and is approximately 95.2% on a year-to-date basis. This aggregate retention rate included 96.1% in its Index segment, 93.6% in its Analytics segment, 97.2% in its ESG & Climate segment, and 94.4% in its All-Other segment. MSCI has been public since 2007, which enables us to examine its growth and retention rates over many economic cycles. Its business units and reporting lines are not identical to those disclosed 15 years ago, but we believe that they are sufficiently comparable to be indicative. Within MSCI’s flagship Index business, we find that aggregate retention rates have ranged from a trough of approximately 92% during 2009’s financial crisis to a peak around 96% in 2021 and 2022. For the company overall, aggregate retention rates have ranged from a low of 84% during the financial crisis to a high of 95% in the same years. These are remarkable retention rates that demonstrate the criticality of MSCI’s solutions and the value proposition that they generate relative to their cost. We see similar long-term evidence of durable recurring revenue with high retention rates throughout our portfolio, which gives us confidence in our investments’ ability to generate attractive financial results across cycles.\n\nShares of MSCI, Inc., a leading provider of investment decision support tools, contributed to performance. Despite the negative impact of broader market weakness on asset-based fee revenue, MSCI reported resilient third quarter earnings results, and the underlying business largely continued to perform well. MSCI owns strong, “all weather” franchises and remains well positioned to benefit from numerous secular tailwinds in the investment community.\"\n\nStory continues FLEX Earnings Call Transcript\n\neverything possible/Shutterstock.com\n\nMSCI Inc.

(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nFourth quarter 2022 highlights:\n\nNet income of $90 million (diluted EPS of $1.12) on net revenue of $899 million Adjusted EBITDA of $225 million and Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.30 (1) Repurchased $108 million of common stock during the fourth quarter\n\nFull-year 2022 highlights:\n\nNet income of $357 million (diluted EPS of $4.24) on net revenue of $3.6 billion Adjusted EBITDA of $859 million and Adjusted diluted EPS of $4.52 Net cash provided by operating activities of $442 million and Adjusted free cash flow of $439 million Repurchased $351 million of common stock during the full-year\n\nOutlook:\n\nFull Year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA expected to range from $920 million to $940 million and first quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA expected to range from $170 million to $180 million The Company will recommend increasing first quarter 2023 dividend to $0.45 per share for approval by the Board of Directors\n\n\"Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our ability to capitalize on the strong leisure travel market and deliver great vacations for our owners and members while maximizing return of capital to our shareholders,\" said Michael D. Brown, president and CEO of Travel + Leisure Co. \"We finished the year with the highest annual sales volume per guest in our company’s history, and returned $486 million of capital to shareholders.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"December’s strong finish has carried into January and February, and our owner reservations on the books are pacing ahead of 2022, underscoring that consumers see the value of our product and are continuing to prioritize vacations.\"\n\n(1) This press release includes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Adjusted free cash flow, Gross VOI sales and Adjusted net income, which are measures that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). See \"Presentation of Financial Information\" and the tables for the definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures are presented in this press release only on a non-GAAP basis because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation is available without unreasonable effort.\n\nBusiness Segment Results\n\nThe results of operations during the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022 and 2021 include impacts related to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Refer to Table 5 for a breakout of COVID-19 related impacts.\n\nVacation Ownership\n\n$ in millions Q4 2022 Q4 2021 % change FY 2022 FY 2021 % change Revenue $737 $700 5 % $2,835 $2,423 17 % Adjusted EBITDA $186 $184 1 % $665 $569 17 %\n\nVacation Ownership revenue increased 5% to $737 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, Gross VOI sales were $521 million compared to $432 million in the prior year period and tours were 147,000 in the fourth quarter compared to 129,000 in the same period last year. Volume Per Guest (VPG) increased 7% to $3,434 due to strong close rates and higher quality tours.\n\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million compared to $184 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher Gross VOI sales due to the ongoing recovery of our operations from COVID-19, partially offset by an adjustment in the prior year to the COVID-19 related allowance for loan losses, which resulted in a $44 million increase to revenue and a $28 million net positive impact to Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nTravel and Membership\n\n$ in millions Q4 2022 Q4 2021 % change FY 2022 FY 2021 % change Revenue $163 $170 (4 )% $735 $714 3 % Adjusted EBITDA $57 $62 (8 )% $268 $271 (1 )%\n\nTravel and Membership revenue decreased 4% to $163 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in Exchange subscription revenue related to a lower average member count and a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $57 million compared to $62 million in the prior year due to the revenue decrease, partially offset by cost savings.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nNet Debt — As of December 31, 2022, the Company's leverage ratio for covenant purposes was 3.5x. The Company had $3.7 billion of corporate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022, which excluded $2.0 billion of non-recourse debt related to its securitized notes receivables portfolio. Additionally, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $550 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, the Company had $1.6 billion of liquidity in cash and cash equivalents and revolving credit facility availability.\n\nThe Company amended the credit agreement governing its $1 billion revolving credit facility and term loan B on December 14, 2022. This amendment provides for an incremental term loan B of $300 million, which will mature on December 14, 2029. We expect to use the net proceeds of the incremental term loan B and revolving credit facility capacity to repay our outstanding $400 million dollar secured notes that mature in March, 2023.\n\nTimeshare Receivables Financing — The Company closed on a $250 million term securitization on October 20, 2022 with a weighted average coupon of 6.91% and an 87.5% advance rate.\n\nCash Flow — For the full-year 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $442 million compared to $568 million in the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow was $439 million in 2022 compared to $223 million in the prior year.\n\nShare Repurchases — During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for $108 million at a weighted average price of $37.41 per share. For the full-year 2022, the Company repurchased 8.2 million shares of common stock for $351 million at a weighted average price of $42.97 per share.

For the full-year 2022, Travel + Leisure Co. paid an aggregate $135 million in dividends to shareholders. Management will recommend a first quarter dividend of $0.45 per share for approval by the Company's Board of Directors in March 2023.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe Company is providing guidance regarding expectations for the 2023 full year:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA to range from $920 million to $940 million Gross VOI sales of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion VPG of $3,050 to $3,150\n\nThe Company is providing guidance regarding expectations for the first quarter 2023:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA to range from $170 million to $180 million Gross VOI sales of $400 million to $420 million VPG of $3,100 to $3,200\n\nThis guidance is presented only on a non-GAAP basis because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is available without unreasonable effort, primarily due to uncertainties relating to the occurrence or amount of these adjustments that may arise in the future. Where one or more of the currently unavailable items is applicable, some items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to GAAP reported results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nTravel + Leisure Co. will hold a conference call with investors to discuss the Company’s results and outlook today at 8:30 a.m. ET. Participants may listen to a simultaneous webcast of the conference call, which may be accessed through the Company's website at travelandleisureco.com/investors, or by dialing 877-733-4794 ten minutes before the scheduled start time. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, an archive of the webcast will be available on the Company's website for 90 days beginning at 12:00 p.m. ET today. Additionally, a telephone replay will be available for seven days beginning at 12:00 p.m. ET today at 877-660-6853.\n\nPresentation of Financial Information\n\nFinancial information discussed in this press release includes non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS, Adjusted free cash flow, gross VOI sales and Adjusted net income, which include or exclude certain items, as well as non-GAAP guidance. The Company utilizes non-GAAP measures, defined in Table 6, on a regular basis to assess performance of its reportable segments and allocate resources. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported GAAP results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons and are helpful to investors when considered with GAAP measures as an additional tool for further understanding and assessing the Company’s ongoing operating performance by adjusting for items which in our view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. Management also internally uses these measures to assess our operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. Exclusion of items in the Company’s non-GAAP presentation should not be considered an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Full reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the reported periods appear in the financial tables section of the press release. See definitions on Table 6 for an explanation of our non-GAAP measures.\n\nAbout Travel + Leisure Co.\n\nAs the world’s leading membership and leisure travel company, Travel + Leisure Co.

Baltimore, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am extremely pleased by our fourth quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and guidance that we provided mid-December, and am encouraged by the positive trends continuing into early 2023. Group business continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter, with group revenue approximately 83% of the fourth quarter of 2019. Business transient demand continues to grow, and despite some seasonal moderation, leisure demand continued to improve at our urban markets. During the fourth quarter, average rates at our resort and airport hotels exceeded 2019 levels by 21% and 8%, respectively, while rate at our urban and suburban hotels exceeded 2019 levels by approximately 2%. Additionally, Park executed on its capital allocation priorities over the past year by completing $435 million of non-core asset sales and recycling this capital into repurchases of nearly $260 million of our common stock and repayments of over $100 million of debt, while also amending and extending our Revolver, further improving the Company's financial flexibility. Looking ahead into 2023, I am excited by the continued positive momentum across our portfolio, with improving city-wide calendars and the return of international travel. We currently do not see recession concerns making a significant impact on our business, and we remain well positioned with approximately $1.9 billion of liquidity to ramp up our dividend distributions and ROI capex spend this year while prudently making opportunistic investments, whether it be additional share repurchases or acquisitions.\"\n\nAdditional Highlights\n\nReopened all previously suspended hotels by May 2022; Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Park’s outlook to Stable from Negative; Reinstated Park's quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2022, declaring a total of $0.28 per share to stockholders for the year, including a dividend of $0.25 per share declared for the fourth quarter of 2022 to common stockholders of record as of December 30, 2022, which was paid on January 17, 2023; Converted the Casa Marina Key West from a Waldorf Astoria Resort to a Curio in March 2022; During 2022, repurchased a total of 12.7 million shares at an average price of $17.82 per share, or $227 million, with an additional 2.5 million shares repurchased in January 2023 at an average price of $11.64 per share, or $30 million; Exited the covenant relief period under Park's credit and term loan facilities in July 2022, one quarter earlier than the scheduled end of the waiver period; Amended and restated Park's revolving credit facility (\"Revolver\") in December 2022, which increased total capacity from $901 million to $950 million, extended the maturity date by three years to December 2026 and released all collateral securing the Revolver and Park's senior notes consisting of pledges of equity interests in Park-affiliated entities owning certain unencumbered properties; In December 2022, fully repaid (i) the remaining $78 million balance on the unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (\"2019 Term Facility\") using $50 million of the Revolver and available cash on hand as well as (ii) the $26 million mortgage loan secured by the Hilton Checkers; Opened the newly constructed 13,000 square foot ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Bonnet Creek in Orlando in December 2022; During 2022, Park has sold its interests in seven non-core hotels for total gross proceeds of approximately $317 million, or 14.0x the hotels’ combined 2019 Adjusted EBITDA (or 12.9x when excluding anticipated capital expenditures), and at an average capitalization rate of 6.2% on the hotels’ combined 2019 net operating income (or 6.7% excluding anticipated maintenance capital expenditures); and In February 2023, sold the 508-room Hilton Miami Airport for gross proceeds of $118.25 million, or $233,000 per key, 14.0x the hotel's 2019 Adjusted EBITDA (or 11.1x when excluding anticipated capital expenditures), and at a capitalization rate of 6.2% on the hotel's 2019 net operating income (or 7.9% excluding anticipated capital expenditures). Park utilized $50 million of the net proceeds to fully repay the outstanding balance on the Revolver.\n\nOperational Update\n\nChanges in Park's 2022 Comparable ADR, Occupancy and RevPAR compared to the same periods in 2021 and 2019, and 2022 Comparable Occupancy were as follows:\n\nChange in Comparable ADR Change in Comparable Occupancy Change in Comparable RevPAR 2022 Comparable 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. 2019 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. 2019 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. 2019 Occupancy Q1 2022 43.7 % 0.8 % 25.3 % pts (26.0 )% pts 183.4 % (33.1 )% 51.4 % Q2 2022 29.0 8.5 29.3 (14.7 ) 120.0 (10.1 ) 70.9 Q3 2022 14.6 7.2 20.9 (12.5 ) 61.7 (8.8 ) 71.7 Oct 2022 20.2 4.0 23.7 (11.2 ) 77.5 (9.7 ) 73.4 Nov 2022 14.4 7.7 15.5 (14.0 ) 48.9 (10.9 ) 67.1 Dec 2022 5.6 14.5 7.7 (13.5 ) 20.5 (5.8 ) 62.5 Q4 2022 12.7 8.4 15.6 (12.9 ) 46.7 (8.9 ) 67.7 2023 vs. 2022 2023 vs. 2019 2023 vs. 2022 2023 vs. 2019 2023 vs. 2022 2023 vs. 2019 2023 Comparable Occupancy Jan 2023 17.8 5.9 19.8 (12.7 ) 76.7 (12.9 ) 59.3\n\nChanges in Park's 2022 Comparable ADR, Occupancy and RevPAR for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 and 2019, and 2022 Comparable Occupancy for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 by hotel type were as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, Change in Comparable ADR Change in Comparable Occupancy Change in Comparable RevPAR 2022 Comparable 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. 2019 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. 2019 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. 2019 Occupancy Resort 3.7 % 21.0 % 11.3 % pts (8.9 )% pts 22.4 % 8.2 % 74.3 % Urban 19.1 1.5 19.9 (16.7 ) 73.3 (19.6 ) 63.6 Airport 20.0 7.9 9.3 (9.2 ) 38.4 (4.5 ) 70.5 Suburban 31.3 2.3 19.0 (11.2 ) 88.6 (13.3 ) 62.5 All Types 12.7 8.4 15.6 (12.9 ) 46.7 (8.9 ) 67.7\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding Park's San Francisco hotels, Comparable Occupancy was 69.9%, or 90% of 2019 levels, with an increase in Comparable rate of 14.1% and Comparable RevPAR at 2019 levels.

The amended agreement adjusted certain financial covenants to revised levels through the end of the first quarter of 2024, allows Park to conduct share repurchases, subject to compliance with the financial covenants, and released all collateral securing the credit facility and senior notes. It also placed restrictions on the Company, including Park’s ability to grant liens on certain properties, mergers, affiliate transactions, asset sales and the payment of dividends and distributions (except to the extent required to maintain REIT status and certain other agreed exceptions).\n\nIn addition, Park fully repaid the $26 million mortgage loan secured by the Hilton Checkers Los Angeles in December 2022 and expects to fully repay the $75 million mortgage loan secured by the W Chicago – City Center (due in August 2023) in May 2023 with available cash on hand.

The Board authorized and approved a new stock repurchase program allowing Park to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock over a two-year period, starting on February 21, 2023 and ending on February 21, 2025, subject to any applicable limitations or restrictions set forth in Park's credit facility and indentures related to its senior notes. Stock repurchases may be made through open market purchases, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading programs, in privately negotiated transactions, or in such other manner that would comply with applicable securities laws. The timing of any future stock repurchases and the number of shares to be repurchased will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors, and Park may suspend the repurchase program at any time. No stock repurchases have been made to date under the new program.\n\nQ1 2023 and Full-Year 2023 Outlook\n\nPark expects first quarter and full-year 2023 operating results to be as follows:\n\n(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per share amounts and RevPAR) Q1 2023 Outlook Full-Year 2023 Outlook as of February 22, 2023 as of February 22, 2023 Metric Low High Low High RevPAR $ 156 $ 162 $ 167 $ 179 RevPAR change vs. 2022 34 % 40 % 7 % 14 % Net income $ 12 $ 28 $ 92 $ 180 Net income attributable to stockholders $ 11 $ 27 $ 78 $ 166 Earnings per share – Diluted(1) $ 0.05 $ 0.12 $ 0.35 $ 0.75 Operating income $ 63 $ 79 $ 316 $ 396 Operating income margin 10.6 % 12.2 % 12.7 % 14.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 124 $ 140 $ 610 $ 690 Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin 22.8 % 23.4 % 26.7 % 27.3 % Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin change vs. 2022 400 bps 460 bps 80 bps 140 bps Adjusted FFO per share – Diluted(1) $ 0.30 $ 0.37 $ 1.60 $ 1.99\n\n(1 ) Per share amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers.\n\nPark's outlook is based in part on the following assumptions:\n\nFully diluted weighted average shares are expected to be 222 million for both Q1 2023 and full-year 2023; The repayment of the $75 million mortgage loan secured by the W Chicago – City Center in May 2023; An increase in interest expense during the second half of 2023 upon extending the maturity date of the $725 million mortgage loan secured by the Hilton San Francisco Union Square and Parc 55 Hotel San Francisco; The mortgage loan secured by the Hilton Denver City Center is not called by the lender during 2023; The removal of $4 million and $12 million, respectively, of Hotel Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 and full-year related to the sale of the Hilton Miami Airport; Includes $14 million of Hotel Adjusted EBITDA disruption from a full-scale renovation at the Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023; and Current portfolio as of February 22, 2023 and does not take into account potential future acquisitions and dispositions, which could result in a material change to Park’s outlook.\n\nPark's first quarter and full-year 2023 outlook are based on a number of factors, many of which are outside the Company's control, including uncertainty surrounding macro-economic factors, including inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions and the possibility of an economic recession or slowdown, as well as the assumptions set forth above, all of which are subject to change.\n\nSupplemental Disclosures\n\nIn conjunction with this release, Park has furnished a financial supplement with additional disclosures on its website.

Additionally, in 2022, Park was recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for the third consecutive year, ranking in the top third of all selected companies, and Park received the 2022 Nareit Leader in the Light Award for the hospitality sector.

The executive-level ESG committee provides oversight of Park's three dedicated ESG working committees – the Green Park Committee, the Park Cares Committee, and the Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee. ESG performance targets were also embedded into executive performance objectives and compensation.\n\nConference Call\n\nPark will host a conference call for investors and other interested parties to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2022 results on February 23, 2023 beginning at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.

      "title": "Huntsman's (HUN) Earnings Miss, Sales Beat Estimates in Q4",
      "content": "Huntsman Corporation HUN slipped to a loss of $91 million or 48 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 from a profit of $597 million or $2.73 in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nBarring one-time items, adjusted earnings per share fell 96% to 4 cents in the reported quarter from 89 cents in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents.\r\n\r\nRevenues were $1,650 million, down around 22% year over year. The top line, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,556.9 million.\n\nHuntsman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Huntsman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nHuntsman Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Huntsman Corporation Quote\n\nSegment Highlights\n\nPolyurethanes: Revenues from the segment fell 23% year over year to $1,071 million in the reported quarter, hurt by reduced sales volumes and unfavorable currency translation, partly offset by higher MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) average selling prices. Volumes fell mainly due to lower demand, especially in European and American markets.\r\n\r\nPerformance Products: Revenues fell 25% to $307 million courtesy of lower sales volumes resulting from weak demand for certain products, which were partially offset by higher average selling prices resulting from a rise in raw material costs.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Materials: Revenues from the unit went down 12% to $278 million primarily due to lower sales volume resulting from weak demand prevailing in the industrial market and the deselection of lower margin businesses. These headwinds were offset by higher demand in the aerospace market, rise in average selling prices and improvement in the sales mix.\n\nFY22 Results\n\nEarnings for full-year 2022 were $2.27 per share compared with $4.72 a year ago. Net sales rose 5% to $8,023 million.\n\nFinancials\n\nHuntsman had total cash of $654 million at the end of the quarter, down around 37% year over year. Long-term debt amounted to $1,671 million, up roughly 9%.\r\n\r\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $297 million in the reported quarter. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $211 million compared with $648 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nHuntsman expects its business fundamentals to improve as it sees higher demand in aerospace and automotive business and expects consumer destocking to end in the first half of 2023. However, the company expects its performance in the second half to be soft, as it is still seeing weakness in the global construction market.\r\n\r\nHuntsman remains focused on creating shareholder value and is constantly working toward implementing its cost-reduction programs and making strategic investments to further improve its core business.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Huntsman have declined 27.7% in the past year against a 9.4% rise of the industry.

      "content": "LONDON, February 22, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LivaNova PLC (Nasdaq: LIVN), a market-leading medical technology and innovation company, today reported results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022 and issued guidance for 2023.\n\nFourth-Quarter Financial Summary and Highlights1\n\nFourth-quarter revenue of $274.9 million increased 1.8 percent on a reported basis and 6.2 percent on a constant-currency basis, as compared to the prior-year period Fourth-quarter U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.03 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.81 Completed first clinical cases using EssenzTM, the Company's next-generation perfusion system, at two major centers in Europe Received ECMO indication 510(k) clearance for LifeSPARCTM Received close-out of FDA Warning Letter associated with the Munich facility and 3T Heater-CoolerTM\n\nFull-Year Financial Summary1\n\nFull-year 2022 revenue of $1.02 billion decreased 1.3 percent on a reported basis and increased 2.9 percent on a constant-currency basis, as compared to the prior year Full-year 2022 revenue, excluding revenue from the Heart Valve business which was divested effective June 1, 2021, increased 2.3 percent on a reported basis and 6.7 percent on a constant-currency basis, as compared to the prior year Full-year 2022 U.S. GAAP diluted loss per share was $1.61 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.39\n\n\"We delivered revenue growth across all regions in the fourth quarter, excluding foreign currency impact, led by our Cardiopulmonary and Neuromodulation business units,\" said Damien McDonald, Chief Executive Officer of LivaNova. \"In 2023, we remain committed to executing on our core growth drivers, delivering on clinical and product pipeline opportunities, and driving operating leverage to improve cash flow.\"\n\nFourth-Quarter 2022 Results\n\nThe following table summarizes revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 by segment (in millions):\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, % Change Constant-Currency\n\n% Change 2022 2021 Cardiopulmonary $136.5 $133.1 2.5 % 9.3 % Neuromodulation 127.1 121.6 4.6 % 6.7 % Advanced Circulatory Support 9.6 13.8 (30.2 )% (30.0 )% Other 1.6 1.6 4.8 % 15.8 % Total Net Revenue $274.9 $270.1 1.8 % 6.2 %\n\nNote: Constant-currency percent change excludes the impact from fluctuations in the various currencies in which the Company operates as compared to reported percent change. Constant-currency percent change is a non-GAAP metric. For an explanation of this and other non-GAAP metrics used in this release, see the section entitled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" Numbers may not add precisely due to rounding.\n\nStory continues\n\nCardiopulmonary revenue increased 9.3 percent2 versus the fourth quarter of 2021 with growth across all regions. This growth was primarily driven by oxygenator revenue due to an increase in cardiac surgery procedures across all regions and strength in heart-lung machine placements in the Rest of World region.\n\nNeuromodulation revenue increased 6.7 percent2 versus the fourth quarter of 2021 with growth across all regions. This increase was driven by replacement implants in the U.S. and improving market dynamics in the Europe and Rest of World regions.\n\nAdvanced Circulatory Support (ACS) revenue decreased 30.0 percent2 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily due to a reduction in patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a result of fewer severe COVID cases and in part due to product mix. The decrease was partially offset by growth in non-COVID cases.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2022 operating income was $14.0 million as compared to $24.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter 2022 was $46.8 million, as compared to $40.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, fourth-quarter 2022 diluted earnings per share was $0.03, as compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.81, as compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nFull-Year 2022 Results\n\nThe following table summarizes revenue for full year 2022 by segment (in millions):\n\nYear Ended\n\nDecember 31, % Change Constant-Currency\n\n% Change 2022 2021 Cardiopulmonary $500.3 $483.0 3.6 % 10.5 % Neuromodulation 477.0 456.2 4.6 % 6.7 % Advanced Circulatory Support 39.3 55.5 (29.1 )% (28.8 )% Other(1) 5.2 40.8 (87.2 )% (85.7 )% Total Net Revenue 1,021.8 1,035.4 (1.3 )% 2.9 % Less: Heart Valves — 36.2 N/A N/A Total Net Revenue, Excluding Heart Valves $1,021.8 $999.2 2.3 % 6.7 %\n\nNote: Constant-currency percent change excludes the impact from fluctuations in the various currencies in which the Company operates as compared to reported percent change. Constant-currency percent change is a non-GAAP metric. For an explanation of this and other non-GAAP metrics used in this release, see the section entitled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" Numbers may not add precisely due to rounding.\r\n(1) Other for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes net revenue of the Heart Valve business, which was divested effective June 1, 2021.\n\nCardiopulmonary revenue increased 10.5 percent2 versus full-year 2021 with growth across all regions. The growth was primarily driven by oxygenators due to an increase in cardiac surgery procedures across all regions and strength in heart-lung machine placements in the Rest of World region.\n\nNeuromodulation revenue increased 6.7 percent2 versus 2021 with growth across all regions. This increase was driven by replacement implants in the U.S. as well as improving market dynamics in the Europe and Rest of World regions.\n\nACS revenue decreased 28.8 percent2 compared to 2021 primarily due to a reduction in patients treated with ECMO related to fewer severe COVID cases, product mix and hospital resource challenges. The decrease was partially offset by growth in non-COVID cases.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, full-year 2022 operating loss was $76.8 million, as compared to $0.8 million for full-year 2021. Adjusted operating income for full-year 2022 was $145.1 million, as compared to $154.8 million for full-year 2021.\n\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, full-year 2022 diluted loss per share was $1.61, as compared to $2.68 for full-year 2021. Full-year 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.39, as compared to $2.07 for full-year 2021.\n\nSubsequent Event\n\nFollowing the second interim analysis, which was conducted after enrolling 500 patients in the ANTHEM-HFrEF clinical study, the Company is stopping enrollment, beginning the process to close the clinical study and winding down the heart failure program. Further evaluation of the study data has not revealed a sufficiently strong positive impact on functional or mortality endpoints, and it is unlikely that the study would demonstrate such an impact. While it appears that there may be benefit for some patients, the magnitude of the expected benefit is insufficient to continue the study. It is important to note that the decision to stop enrolling was not associated with any safety concerns.\n\nFull-Year 2023 Guidance\n\nLivaNova expects revenue for full-year 2023 to grow between 3 and 5 percent on a constant-currency basis. Foreign currency is expected to be a 1 percent tailwind.\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share for 2023 are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65, assuming a share count of 54 million for full-year 2023. In 2023, the Company estimates that adjusted free cash flow will be in the range of $80 to $100 million.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Instructions\n\nThe Company will host a live audiocast for interested parties commencing at 1 p.m. London time (8 a.m. Eastern Time) on Wednesday, February 22, 2023 that will be accessible at www.livanova.com/events.

For an explanation of these and other non-GAAP measures used in this release, see the section entitled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" For reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures, see the tables that accompany this press release. 2 Revenue growth rates reflect comparable, constant-currency growth.\n\nAbout LivaNova\n\nLivaNova PLC is a global medical technology and innovation company built on nearly five decades of experience and a relentless commitment to provide hope for patients and their families through innovative medical technologies, delivering life-changing improvements for both the Head and Heart. Headquartered in London, LivaNova employs approximately 2,900 employees and has a presence in more than 100 countries for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems worldwide. For more information, please visit www.livanova.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn this press release, management has disclosed financial measurements that present financial information not in accordance with GAAP. Company management uses these measurements as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter and year to year on a regular basis and for benchmarking against other medical technology companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, operating performance measures as prescribed by GAAP.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all revenue growth rates in this release reflect comparable, constant-currency percent change. Management believes that referring to comparable, constant-currency percent change is the most useful way to evaluate the revenue performance of LivaNova and to compare the revenue performance of current periods to prior periods on a consistent basis. Constant-currency percent change, a non-GAAP financial measure, measures the change in revenue between current and prior-year periods using average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period.\n\nLivaNova calculates forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For example, forward-looking net revenue growth projections are estimated on a constant-currency basis and exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance exclude other items such as, but not limited to, changes in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration arrangements and asset impairment charges that would be included in comparable GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for constant-currency net revenue, non-GAAP adjusted tax rate and adjusted diluted earnings per share are net revenue, the effective tax rate and earnings per share, respectively. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. However, non-GAAP financial adjustments on a forward-looking basis are subject to uncertainty and variability as they are dependent on many factors, including but not limited to, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, impacts from potential acquisitions or divestitures, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, gains or losses on the potential sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs, merger and integration activities, changes in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration arrangements, asset impairment charges and the tax impact of the aforementioned items, tax law changes or other tax matters. Accordingly, forward-looking GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nThe Company also believes adjusted financial measures such as adjusted gross profit percentage, adjusted selling, general and administrative expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted other operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are measures by which LivaNova generally uses to facilitate management review of the operational performance of the company, to serve as a basis for strategic planning and to assist in the design of compensation incentive plans. Additionally, the Company also uses the non-GAAP liquidity measure adjusted free cash flow. Furthermore, adjusted financial measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s core performance for different periods on a more comparable and consistent basis, and with other entities in the medical technology industry by adjusting for items that are not related to the ongoing operations of the Company or incurred in the ordinary course of business.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nCertain statements in this press release, other than purely historical information, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(NASDAQ/TSX: SSRM, ASX: SSR) (\"SSR Mining\" or the \"Company\") reports consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per common share payable on March 30, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2023. This dividend qualifies as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian tax purposes.\n\nRod Antal, President and CEO of SSR Mining, said, \"We closed 2022 with a strong balance sheet and met our revised guidance targets. We are now focused on delivering strong production and free cash flow in 2023. With the release of our 2023 and three-year guidance earlier this month, we presented our expectations for a significant year-over-year production improvement and a three-year production profile targeting 700,000 gold equivalent ounces.\n\nOur 2023 cost guidance incorporates two significant growth initiatives for the business, the ramp-up at Çöpler’s Çakmaktepe Extension where first production is expected within the year, and waste stripping activities at Marigold’s Red Dot as we aim to optimize Marigold’s longer-term production profile. These initiatives, along with our continued advancement of the C2 expansion project at Çöpler and exploration and resource development activities across the portfolio, are key elements of our plan to sustain a longer-term production platform at or above 700,000 gold equivalent ounces annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite our continued and significant reinvestment in the business, we expect to deliver another strong year of free cash flow and capital returns to shareholders. The Company has a number of potential key catalysts targeted for 2023, including continued work on updated mine plans at Çöpler incorporating the C2 expansion project, and at Marigold highlighting the initial contribution of the New Millennium target. All considered, we see a strong and exciting year ahead for the business.\"\n\n___________________________\r\n(1) The Company reports non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted attributable net income, adjusted attributable net income per share, cash generated by operating activities before working capital adjustments, free cash flow, free cash flow before changes in working capital, net cash (debt), cash costs and AISC per ounce sold a common measure in the mining industry), to manage and evaluate its operating performance at its mines. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for an explanation of these financial measures and a reconciliation of these financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\r\n(2) During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company has revised the \"Production costs\" caption to \"Cost of sales\" within its Consolidated Statements of Operations to provide a more accurate description of the costs and align with commonly used terminology by industry participants. No changes were made to the previously reported amounts or the applicable accounting policies. Cost of sales excludes depreciation, depletion, and amortization.\n\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Highlights: (All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted)\n\nSolid fourth quarter operating performance: Delivered fourth quarter production of 182,655 gold equivalent ounces at cost of sales of $1,064 per gold equivalent ounce and AISC of $1,358 per gold equivalent ounce. For the full year 2022, SSR Mining reported production of 623,819 gold equivalent ounces at cost of sales of $985 per gold equivalent ounce and AISC of $1,339 per gold equivalent ounce. Production and costs were previously reported in early February 2023 and were in line with revised 2022 guidance. Announced 2023 guidance and three-year operating outlook: Previously announced 2023 production guidance of 700,000 to 780,000 gold equivalent ounces at consolidated cost of sales of $1,055 to $1,115 per gold equivalent ounce and AISC of $1,365 to $1,425 per gold equivalent ounce. SSR Mining’s three-year outlook highlights a strong and stable production base of approximately 700,000 gold equivalent ounces through 2025 without requiring significant capital investment. The Company believes these production levels are sustainable through the end of the decade. Strong quarterly free cash flow: Attributable net income in the fourth quarter was $93.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, and adjusted attributable net income was $25.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $118.1 million with free cash flow of $96.7 million and free cash flow before changes in working capital of $74.1 million. For the full year 2022, attributable net income was $194.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share and adjusted attributable net income was $144.8 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2022, operating cash flow was $160.9 million, free cash flow was $23.4 million and free cash flow before changes in working capital was $170.7 million. Continued delivery of peer-leading capital returns program: For the twelve months ending December 31, 2022, SSR Mining returned $158.8 million to shareholders, marking the Company’s second consecutive year with a capital returns yield of approximately 5.0%. Quarterly dividend payments in 2022 totaled $58.8 million, reflecting SSR Mining’s announcement of a 40% increase to the base dividend on January 31, 2022. In addition, the Company returned $100.0 million to shareholders through the cancellation of 6,053,126 shares as part of SSR Mining’s current NCIB program. Subsequent to the quarter, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share to be payable on March 30, 2023. Robust balance sheet with strong net cash position: At the end of 2022, SSR Mining had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $655.5 million reflecting $58.8 million in dividend payments to shareholders, $100.0 million in share repurchases, $71.2 million in scheduled debt repayments, and $170.0 million for strategic M&A transactions, including the acquisition of Taiga Gold Corp. for $20.0 million and 30% of the Kartaltepe joint venture for $150.0 million. Net cash as of year-end 2022 was $387.3 million. Technical Report Summaries published for all producing assets: On February 23, 2022, the Company released Technical Report Summaries (\"TRS\") for each of its operating assets in compliance with Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, which TRS were subsequently amended and released on September 29, 2022. These reports include refreshed operating and economic assumptions for each asset and provided a base case for further growth and optimization to support the Company’s target of a long-term annual production base of 700,000 gold equivalent ounces. Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resource: The Company reported updated Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource (\"MRMR\") figures as of December 31, 2022 in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Annual Report\"), including total Mineral Reserves of 7.6 million gold ounces and 8.3 million gold equivalent ounces. This MRMR update does not incorporate new drilling results or resource modeling changes since the prior MRMR’s December 31, 2021 effective date and accordingly solely reflects depletion that occurred through 2022 mining activity, stockpile changes and changes resulting from asset acquisitions and divestment activity completed in 2022. Çöpler operations return to steady state with record sulfide plant throughput: Gold production was 65,603 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2022 at cost of sales of $1,065/oz and AISC of $1,269/oz, reflecting the successful restart of operations that began in the third quarter of 2022. Sulfide plant throughput in the fourth quarter of 2022 averaged more than 8,000 tonnes per day (\"tpd\"), a quarterly record. In 2022, gold production for Çöpler was 191,366 ounces, above the revised full-year guidance, at full-year cost of sales of $985/oz and AISC of $1,328/oz. In 2023, Çöpler is expected to produce 240,000 to 270,000 ounces of gold, 55% weighted to the second half of 2023, at mine site cost of sales of $1,070 to $1,100 per ounce and AISC of $1,245 to $1,295 per ounce. Çöpler’s cost profile in 2023 reflects the ramp up of the Çakmaktepe Extension project, where first production is expected within the year. Marigold delivers solid cost performance in fourth quarter; poised for strong 2023: Gold production was 62,875 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2022, a solid finish that included the continued recovery of the higher grade ounces stacked earlier in 2022. Cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1,004/oz and AISC of $1,160/oz. In 2022, gold production for Marigold was 194,668 ounces, in line with revised full-year guidance, at cost of sales of $1,053/oz and AISC of $1,378/oz. In 2023, Marigold is expected to produce 260,000 to 290,000 ounces of gold, 60 to 70% weighted to the second half of 2023, at cost of sales of $1,000 to $1,030 per ounce and AISC of $1,315 to $1,365 per ounce. Seabee delivers record full-year production: Gold production was 24,709 ounces at cost of sales of $909/oz and AISC of $1,234/oz in the fourth quarter of 2022. Underground mining and plant throughput averaged approximately 1,300 tonnes per day during the fourth quarter, highlighting the ongoing success of continuous improvement initiatives at the mine. For 2022, gold production for Seabee was a record 136,125 ounces at cost of sales of $559/oz and AISC of $823/oz. Seabee is expected to produce 100,000 to 110,000 ounces of gold in 2023, 55% weighted to the second half of 2023, at mine site cost of sales of $810 to $840 per ounce and AISC of $1,160 to $1,210 per ounce. Strong finish to a solid year at Puna: Silver production was 2.4 million ounces in the fourth quarter of 2022 at cost of sales of $16.53/oz and AISC of $15.97/oz. For 2022, Puna’s silver production was 8.4 million ounces at cost of sales of $17.48/oz and AISC of $15.50/oz, all metrics within the mine’s original full year guidance range. In 2023, Puna is expected to produce 8.0 to 9.0 million ounces of silver, 50 – 55% weighted to the second half of 2023, at mine site cost of sales of $18.00 to $19.50 per payable ounce and AISC of $16.25 to $17.75 per payable ounce. Closed the acquisition of Taiga Gold Corp.: On April 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Taiga Gold Corp. The transaction consolidated a 100% interest in the Fisher property contiguous to the Seabee mine, eliminated a 2.5% NSR royalty on the Fisher property, and added five new properties covering over 29,100 hectares to complement the Company’s existing exploration platform in the underexplored and geologically prospective Province of Saskatchewan. The Company’s Saskatchewan assets now cover an area of approximately 131,150 hectares. In 2023, up to 35% of Seabee’s exploration budget is planned for follow-up drilling of targets on the Fisher property. Completed the sale of the non-core Pitarrilla project: On July 6, 2022 the Company announced the closing of the sale of the Pitarrilla project to Endeavour Silver following receipt of all required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As consideration for the sale, SSR Mining received $35.0 million in cash, $35.0 million (3) in common shares of Endeavour Silver, and a 1.25% net smelter return royalty on the Pitarrilla property. The sale was originally announced on January 13, 2022. Closed the acquisition of an additional 30% ownership in Kartaltepe: In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company announced and completed an agreement to acquire an additional 30% ownership interest in the Kartaltepe Mining Joint Venture at the Çöpler District from partner Lidya Mining for total cash consideration of $150.0 million (the \"Kartaltepe Transaction\"), streamlining operating, financial and exploration activities across the Ҫӧpler District while creating tangible synergies. The Company now owns 80% of the entirety of the Çöpler District. Delivered strong near-mine exploration results across the portfolio: In the fourth quarter of 2022, SSR Mining announced positive exploration updates from Çöpler’s Çakmaktepe Extension, Seabee, and Marigold. These results showcase the opportunities for growth across SSR Mining’s global platform and may be incorporated into future MRMR updates as the required technical work is completed at each respective project.\n\n(3) The fair value of the common shares of Endeavour Silver on July 6, 2022 was $25.6 million. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in SSR Mining’s Form 10-K filed February 22, 2023 for more information.\n\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\n\nA summary of the Company's consolidated financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are presented below:\n\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (in thousands of US dollars, except per share data) December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Financial Results Revenue $ 306,377 $ 407,919 $ 1,148,033 $ 1,474,199 Operating income $ 39,367 $ 118,816 $ 190,268 $ 444,375 Net income $ 95,177 $ 156,499 $ 210,428 $ 425,922 Net income attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining $ 93,884 $ 127,435 $ 194,140 $ 368,076 Basic net income per share attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining $ 0.45 $ 0.60 $ 0.92 $ 1.70 Diluted net income per share attributable to equity holders of SSR Mining $ 0.43 $ 0.57 $ 0.89 $ 1.63 Adjusted attributable net income (4) $ 25,580 $ 98,259 $ 144,814 $ 401,757 Adjusted basic attributable net income per share (4) $ 0.12 $ 0.46 $ 0.69 $ 1.86 Adjusted diluted attributable net income per share (4) $ 0.12 $ 0.44 $ 0.67 $ 1.78 Cash generated by operating activities before changes in working capital (4) $ 95,463 $ 157,218 $ 308,166 $ 638,281 Cash generated by operating activities $ 118,097 $ 184,606 $ 160,896 $ 608,986 Cash generated by (used in) investing activities $ (166,299) $ 1,362 $ (236,282) $ (129,137) Cash generated by (used in) financing activities $ (33,148) $ (29,380) $ (271,782) $ (319,769) Operating Results Gold produced (oz) 153,187 185,044 522,159 683,446 Gold sold (oz) 146,385 186,159 521,928 689,354 Silver produced ('000 oz) 2,389 2,044 8,397 8,010 Silver sold ('000 oz) 2,098 2,461 7,864 7,810 Lead produced ('000 lb) (5) 13,422 11,318 41,004 37,695 Lead sold ('000 lb) (5) 10,138 12,748 38,393 33,378 Zinc produced ('000 lb) (5) 3,643 3,208 8,583 13,642 Zinc sold ('000 lb) (5) 1,452 4,855 6,998 10,751 Gold equivalent produced (oz) (6) 182,655 211,140 623,819 794,456 Gold equivalent sold (oz) (6) 172,308 218,271 617,135 797,602 Average realized gold price ($/oz sold) $ 1,749 $ 1,798 $ 1,811 $ 1,800 Average realized silver price ($/oz sold) $ 18.58 $ 23.48 $ 19.58 $ 22.92 Cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce sold (6) $ 1,064 $ 861 $ 985 $ 842 Cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold (4, 6) $ 1,019 $ 697 $ 928 $ 698 AISC per gold equivalent ounce sold (4, 6) $ 1,358 $ 961 $ 1,339 $ 955 Financial Position December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 655,453 $ 1,017,562 Current assets $ 1,376,435 $ 1,600,314 Total assets $ 5,254,657 $ 5,211,438 Current liabilities $ 279,252 $ 283,882 Total liabilities $ 1,128,458 $ 1,158,921 Working capital (7) $ 1,097,183 $ 1,316,432\n\n(4) The Company reports non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted attributable net income, adjusted attributable net income per share, cash generated by operating activities before changes in working capital, cash costs and AISC per ounce sold to manage and evaluate its operating performance at its mines. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this press release for an explanation of these financial measures and a reconciliation of these financial measures to net income, cost of sales, and cash generated by operating activities, which are the most comparable GAAP financial measures. (5) Data for lead production and sales relate only to lead in lead concentrate. Data for zinc production and sales relate only to zinc in zinc concentrate. (6) Gold equivalent ounces are calculated multiplying the silver ounces by the ratio of the silver price to the gold price, using the average London Bullion Market Association (\"LBMA\") prices for the period. The Company does not include by-products in the gold equivalent ounce calculations. (7) Working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities.\n\nUpdated Mineral Reserves and Resources for Year End 2022\n\nSSR Mining reported its updated MRMR as of December 31, 2022 in the Company’s Annual Report. For a detailed summary by asset, please refer to Item 2 Properties in the annual report, and for a reconciliation of year-over-year changes to the MRMR figures below, please see \"Supplemental Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Information\" at the end of this news release.\n\nAs per Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, MRMR are presented on an attributable basis.\n\nThe MRMR as of December 31, 2022 reflect depletion that occurred through mining activity, stockpile changes and changes resulting from asset acquisitions and divestments completed during 2022. SSR Mining continues to advance exploration and resource development activities at each of its assets, and this data will be incorporated into MRMR statements as the accompanying technical work so dictates. A summary of the Company’s year-end 2022 MRMR are presented below:\n\nCommodity price assumptions unchanged from 2021: Commodity prices used in the calculation of Mineral Reserves for both 2022 and 2021 are $1,350/oz gold, $18.50/oz silver, $0.90/lb of lead, $1.05/lb of zinc, and $3.30/lb copper. Mineral Resource prices of $1,750/oz gold, $22.00/oz silver, $0.95/lb lead, $1.15/lb zinc and $3.95/lb copper were unchanged from 2021. Acquisition of an additional 30% of Kartaltepe;Pitarrilla divested: In the fourth quarter of 2022, SSR Mining closed the Kartaltepe Transaction, consolidating SSR Mining’s 80% ownership of the entire Çöpler district. On an attributable basis, the transaction added 64,000 gold equivalent ounces in Mineral Reserves, 123,000 gold equivalent ounces in Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources, and 124,000 gold equivalent ounces in Inferred Mineral Resources to the Company’s MRMR. The accretive sale of the non-core Pitarrilla project in 2022 drove the reduction of silver and base metal Mineral Resources. Mineral Reserves: Gold Mineral Reserves as of December 31, 2022 were 7.6 million, down 5% or 0.4 million ounces as compared to year-end 2021 Mineral Reserves reflecting mine depletion. Total gold equivalent Mineral Reserves as of December 31, 2022 were 8.3 million ounces, down 6% or 0.6 million ounces from 8.9 million ounces as compared to year-end 2021. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources: Gold Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as of December 31, 2022 were 5.8 million ounces, effectively flat as compared to year-end 2021. Total gold equivalent Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were 7.3 million ounces, a decrease of 9.5 million ounces from the prior year as a result of the divestment of the Pitarrilla project in 2022. Inferred Mineral Resources: Gold Inferred Mineral Resources of 4.7 million ounces increased by 2% or 0.1 million ounces as compared to year-end 2021 Inferred Mineral Resources, a result of the acquisition of an additional 30% interest at the Kartaltepe licenses. Gold equivalent Inferred Mineral Resources of 5.8 million ounces decreased by 6% or 0.3 million ounces as compared to year-end 2021 Inferred Mineral Resources. This was largely driven by lower silver ounces as a result of the sale of Pitarrilla in 2022.\n\nSSR Mining Mineral Reserves and Resources as of December 31, 2022 (8)\n\nGold y/y Silver y/y Lead Zinc Copper GEO (11) koz % koz % Mlb Mlb Mlb Koz Total P+P Reserves (9) 7,620 (5%) 39,903 (13%) 190 37 7 8,339 Total M&I Resource (10) 5,753 0% 67,162 (89%) 111 281 224 7,349 Total Inferred Resource 4,716 2% 38,696 (41%) 2 178 228 5,836\n\n(8) MRMR are shown as attributable to SSR Mining only. SSR owns 80% of the Çöpler district. (9) At Seabee, a $1,600/oz gold price was used in the calculation of Mineral Reserves for 2021 and 2022 to better align with site-level mine plans. (10) Measured and indicated Mineral Resources are shown exclusive of Mineral Reserves. (11) All gold equivalent ounces (GEO) figures are based on the above-mentioned commodity prices. metal equivalence is calculated for the respective and applicable metals as follows: AuEq = Au koz + ((Ag koz * Ag price) + (Pb klb * Pb price per pound) + (Zn klb * Zn price per pound) + (Cu klb * Cu price per pound)) / (Au price per ounce).\n\nÇöpler, Türkiye (amounts presented on 100% basis)\n\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, Operating Data 2022 2021 2022 2021 Gold produced (oz) 65,603 92,069 191,366 329,276 Gold sold (oz) 59,949 94,333 192,811 333,761 Ore mined (kt) 1,407 2,270 3,161 9,750 Waste removed (kt) 5,596 4,124 17,311 15,015 Total material mined (kt) 7,003 6,395 20,472 24,765 Strip ratio 4.0 1.8 5.5 1.5 Ore stacked (kt) 249 95 459 1,786 Gold grade stacked (g/t) 1.22 1.07 1.06 1.24 Ore milled (kt) 748 609 2,068 2,325 Gold mill feed grade (g/t) 2.75 4.11 2.86 3.71 Gold recovery (%) 86.8 91.0 87.0 91.0 Average realized gold price ($/oz sold) $ 1,743 $ 1,789 $ 1,826 $ 1,800 Cost of sales ($/oz gold sold) $ 1,065 $ 667 $ 985 $ 794 Cash costs ($/oz gold sold) (12) $ 1,053 $ 474 $ 969 $ 578 AISC ($/oz gold sold) (12) $ 1,269 $ 591 $ 1,328 $ 713\n\n(12) The Company reports the non-GAAP financial measures of cash costs and AISC per ounce of gold sold to manage and evaluate operating performance at Çöpler. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for an explanation of these financial measures and a reconciliation to cost of sales, which are the comparable GAAP financial measure. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, cash costs and AISC per ounce of gold sold include the impact of any fair value adjustment on acquired inventories. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, cash costs and AISC per ounce of gold sold exclude the impact of any fair value adjustment on acquired inventories.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Çöpler produced 65,603 and 92,069 ounces of gold, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2022, cost of sales was $1,065 per ounce while AISC were $1,269 per ounce. The sulfide plant operated at an average throughput rate of more than 8,000 tonnes per day in the fourth quarter of 2022, a quarterly record and reflecting the successful restart of operations that began in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Çöpler produced 191,366 and 329,276 ounces of gold, respectively. During the full year 2022, cost of sales was $985 per ounce while AISC were $1,328 per ounce. Operations at Çöpler were suspended in late June until late September in response to a leak of leach solution containing diluted cyanide at the Çöpler mine site on June 21, 2022. After completing the required improvement initiatives in early August, the Company received the required regulatory approvals on September 22, 2022 from Türkiye’s Government authorities and all operations were subsequently restarted.\n\nIn 2023, Çöpler is expected to produce 240,000 to 270,000 ounces of gold at mine site cost of sales of $1,070 to $1,100 per payable ounce and AISC of $1,245 to $1,295 per payable ounce, reflecting the costs associated with the ramp up of mining activity at the Çakmaktepe Extension starter pit, where first production is expected in 2023. Ҫӧpler’s production profile is approximately 55% weighted to the second half of 2023, reflecting a second half weighted grade profile and the planned maintenance shutdown in the second quarter of 2023. The C2 expansion project continues to progress towards a pre-feasibility study, including maiden Mineral Reserves and updated Mineral Resources, anticipated in the second half of 2023.\n\nMarigold, USA\n\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, Operating Data 2022 2021 2022 2021 Gold produced (oz) 62,875 57,405 194,668 235,282 Gold sold (oz) 62,936 58,496 195,617 236,847 Ore mined (kt) 4,861 4,478 18,061 19,999 Waste removed (kt) 15,880 21,221 72,166 79,885 Total material mined (kt) 20,741 25,699 90,227 99,884 Strip ratio 3.3 4.7 4.0 4.0 Ore stacked (kt) 4,861 4,478 18,061 19,999 Gold grade stacked (g/t) 0.60 0.39 0.56 0.41 Average realized gold price ($/oz sold) $ 1,719 $ 1,811 $ 1,747 $ 1,763 Cost of sales ($/oz gold sold) $ 1,004 $ 1,085 $ 1,053 $ 925 Cash costs ($/oz gold sold) (13) $ 1,010 $ 1,095 $ 1,056 $ 926 AISC ($/oz gold sold) (13) $ 1,160 $ 1,332 $ 1,378 $ 1,187\n\n(13) The Company reports the non-GAAP financial measures of cash costs and AISC per ounce of gold sold to manage and evaluate operating performance at Marigold. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for an explanation of these financial measures and a reconciliation to cost of sales, which are the comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Marigold produced 62,875 and 57,405 ounces of gold, respectively. The fourth quarter of 2022 represented a strong finish to the year for Marigold and included the continued recovery of the higher grade ounces stacked earlier in 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, cost of sales was $1,004 per ounce while AISC were $1,160 per ounce.\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Marigold produced 194,668 and 235,282 ounces of gold, respectively. During the full year 2022, cost of sales was $1,053 per ounce while AISC were $1,378 per ounce.\n\nIn 2023, Marigold is expected to produce 260,000 to 290,000 ounces of gold at mine site cost of sales of $1,000 to $1,030 per payable ounce and AISC of $1,315 to $1,365 per ounce. For the full year, production is expected to be 60 to 70% weighted to the second half of 2023, reflecting a slower than expected leach cycle due to the increased proportion of finer ore stacked to the pads earlier in 2022. Marigold’s cost profile is expected to largely reflect the 2023 production profile, with first half costs above the full-year guidance range and the lowest cost periods in the third and fourth quarters.\n\nActivities to enhance and extend the Marigold life of mine plan are continuing to advance. This includes accelerating spend associated with waste stripping activity at the Red Dot target in order to optimize the production profile for the remainder of the decade. In 2023, $28 million of Marigold’s $81 million sustaining capital budget is allocated to the purchase of new haul trucks. The stripping activity associated with Red Dot accounts for nearly $100 per ounce of SSR Mining’s corporate-level cost of sales. .\n\nSeabee, Canada\n\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, Operating Data 2022 2021 2022 2021 Gold produced (oz) 24,709 35,570 136,125 118,888 Gold sold (oz) 23,500 33,330 133,500 118,746 Ore mined (kt) 118 97 425 384 Waste removed (kt) 90 63 291 272 Total material mined (kt) 208 160 716 656 Ore milled (kt) 119 113 414 382 Gold mill feed grade (g/t) 6.69 10.32 10.36 9.92 Gold recovery (%) 97.2 98.3 98.0 98.4 Average realized gold price ($/oz sold) $ 1,725 $ 1,805 $ 1,795 $ 1,800 Cost of sales ($/oz gold sold) $ 909 $ 578",

      "title": "Standard Motor Products, Inc. Releases Fourth Quarter and 2022 Year-End Results; Announces Segment Reporting Changes",
      "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard Motor Products, Inc. (NYSE: SMP), a leading automotive parts manufacturer and distributor, reported today its consolidated financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022. (PRNewsfoto/Standard Motor Products, Inc.)\n\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $308.2 million, compared to consolidated net sales of $309.9 million during the same quarter in 2021. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $8.5 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $20.0 million or $0.89 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding non-operational gains and losses identified on the attached reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $15.1 million or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to $20.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nConsolidated net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were $1.37 billion, compared to consolidated net sales of $1.30 billion during the comparable period in 2021.  Earnings from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were $73.0 million or $3.30 per diluted share, compared to $99.4 million or $4.39 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2021.  Excluding non-operational gains and losses identified on the attached reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, earnings from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $79.4 million or $3.59 per diluted share and $100.7 million or $4.45 per diluted share, respectively. Our earnings for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2022 were impacted by the recent announcement of a bankruptcy filing by an Aftermarket customer. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $7.0 million in the fourth quarter related to anticipated losses from this event, which has been treated as a non-operational loss on our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.\n\nMr. Eric Sills, Standard Motor Products' Chief Executive Officer and President stated, \"We are pleased with our full year sales results, up 5.6% from 2021, with both Engine Management and Temperature Control segments performing well. Against a challenging comparison, sales for the fourth quarter dropped a half a percentage point from the same period last year, which was up nearly 10% from 2020.\"\n\nBy segment, Engine Management sales increased 4% for the full year, on top of 12% growth in 2021. However, fourth quarter sales were down slightly, just over 1%, versus a very strong 2021, which was up 6% over the prior year.  Our customers' Engine Management POS sales remained robust in the quarter, reflecting continued market strength and demand for our products.\n\nTemperature Control sales remained strong in the fourth quarter on the strength of winter related products and from another long, hot summer. Sales grew 5.2% in the quarter versus last year, and were up nearly 10% for the full year due to a combination of favorable weather, successful pricing initiatives and overall strength in customer demand.\n\nConsolidated operating profit for the quarter, excluding non-operational gains and losses, was 7.9%, in line with the fourth quarter of 2021. Pricing actions taken earlier in 2022, along with various cost reduction initiatives, largely offset ongoing inflationary pressures.\n\nConsolidated operating profit for the full year, excluding non-operational gains and losses, finished at 8.2%, vs. 10.1% in 2021. As we've noted many times, 2021 was an anomaly year with many non-recurring benefits associated with emerging from COVID lockdowns while still operating in a very low interest rate environment. Our operating profit of 8.2% was more in line with historical trends despite incurring an additional $20.6 million of customer factoring costs, which negatively affected operating profit by 150 basis points as compared to 2021.\n\nMr. Sills added, \"Today we are announcing our new operating segment, 'Engineered Solutions', along with the intent to rename the Engine Management segment to 'Vehicle Control'. These segment changes, beginning in 2023, will better align the Company's operating businesses with its strategic focus as well as provide greater clarity into how the Company is positioned to capture growth opportunities of the future.  Please see our separate press release on these changes, also distributed today, along with a supplementary presentation available on the Company's Investor Relations website. We will discuss in more detail on today's call.\"\n\nAs we head into 2023, our outlook for the full year includes an expectation that sales will grow in the low single digits and Adjusted EBITDA will be approximately 10%.\n\nIn closing, Mr. Sills commented, \"While there still remains uncertainty as it relates to the economy and various global dynamics, we believe our end markets' resiliency and diversification should continue to afford opportunities for new wins and stable levels of growth throughout 2023 and into the future.\"\n\nConference Call Standard Motor Products, Inc. will hold a conference call at 11:00 AM, Eastern Time, on Wednesday, February 22, 2023.  This call will be web cast and can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.smpcorp.com and clicking on the SMP Q4'22 Earnings Call Earnings Webcast link.  Investors may also listen to the call by dialing 800-343-1703 (domestic) or 785-424-1226 (international).  Our playback will be made available for dial in immediately following the call.  For those choosing to listen to the replay by webcast, the link should be active on our website within 24 hours after the call.  The playback number is 800-723-1517 (domestic) or 402-220-2659 (international).

Fourth quarter organic revenues increased 2.9% over the prior year.\n\nThe Company reported GAAP net income of $52.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to GAAP net income of $45.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $109.7 million, compared to $105.4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 27.6%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year period driven by careful OPEX management.\n\nAdjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $78.8 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $72.2 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nCash flows from operations totaled $85.3 million in the fourth quarter and capital expenditures were $14.5 million.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Segment Performance\n\nCodman Specialty Surgical (66% of Revenues)\n\nTotal revenues were $264.6 million, representing reported decrease of 2.2% and organic growth of 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Sales in Neurosurgery grew 1.7% on an organic basis driven by solid growth in CUSA capital and disposables in the US and global small capital sales offset by the recall impact of the CereLink® monitors. Sales in Instruments grew 2.2% on an organic basis.\n\nTissue Technologies (34% of Revenue)\n\nTotal revenues were $133.4 million, representing a decrease of 1.1% on a reported basis and organic growth of 5.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Organic growth in the segment was led by sales in Wound Reconstruction and Care, with broad strength from Integra Skin, amniotics, Primatrix® MicroMatrix® and Cytal®, partially offset by an expected decline in private label.\n\nFull-Year 2022 Financial Summary\n\nTotal reported revenues for the full-year 2022 were $1,557.7 million, an increase of 1.0%, from the prior year. Organic sales for the full-year 2022 increased 4.2% compared to 2021.\n\nThe Company reported GAAP net income of $180.6 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, for the full-year 2022, compared to GAAP net income of $169.1 million, or $1.98 per diluted share in 2021.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2022 was $411.3 million, an increase of $11.3 million over the prior year.

Full-year capital expenditures were $42.3 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $1.0 billion, and the consolidated total leverage ratio was 2.2x. As of year-end, the Company had total liquidity of approximately $1.76 billion, including approximately $457 million in cash and the remainder available under its revolving credit facility.\n\n2023 Revenue and Adjusted Earnings Per Share Guidance\n\nThe Company’s guidance for 2023 revenue and adjusted earnings per share reflects the recovery of our markets back to pre-COVID levels, a gradual improvement in supply over the year, the relaunch of CereLink in the first half, and the impact of our commercial capability build-out and new products. Our guidance also reflects the recent acquisition of DuraSorb as well as the divestiture of the TWC business.\n\nFor the full-year 2023, the Company expects revenues to be in a range of $1,602 million to $1,620 million, representing reported growth of approximately 2.9% to 4.0% and organic growth in the range of 4.0% to 5.2%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $3.43 and $3.51.\n\nOur guidance reflects a sequential improvement from first to second half growth primarily driven by the gradual recovery of supply throughout the year, 2022 normalization from our private label business, the recovery of our China business post-COVID lockdowns, and the timing of the CereLink relaunch. The acquisition of DuraSorb and divestiture of the TWC business also contributed to the sequential step-up in growth.\n\nFor the first quarter 2023, the Company expects reported revenues in the range of $370 million to $376 million, representing reported growth of approximately -1.5% to flat and organic growth of approximately 2.0% to 3.5%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be in a range of $0.72 to $0.76.\n\nOrganic sales growth excludes acquisitions and divestitures as well as the effects of foreign currency and the year- over-year change in revenue from discontinued products.\n\nThe Company is providing forward-looking guidance regarding adjusted earnings per diluted share but is not providing a reconciliation to GAAP earnings per share, because certain GAAP expense items are highly variable, and management is unable to predict them with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort. Specifically, the financial impact and timing of divestitures, acquisitions, integrations, structural optimization and efforts to comply with the EU Medical Device Regulation are uncertain, depend on various dynamic factors and are not reasonably ascertainable at this time. These expense items could have a material impact on GAAP results. Adjusted earnings per diluted share also excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization associated with prior business acquisitions, which we expect to be approximately $0.80 per diluted share for the full-year 2023.\n\n2023 Share Repurchase\n\nOn January 26, 2023, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to repurchase $150 million in the aggregate of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The repurchase transactions are expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. The impact of the share repurchase is reflected in the 2023 adjusted earning per diluted share guidance range provided.\n\nConference Call and Presentation Available Online\n\nIntegra has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, February 22, 2023, to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results, and forward-looking financial guidance.

Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income excluding: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) other income (expense); (iii) interest income and expense; (iv) income tax expense (benefit); and (v) those operating expenses also excluded from adjusted net income.   The measure of adjusted net income consists of GAAP net income, excluding: (i) structural optimization charges; (ii) divestiture, acquisition and integration-related charges; (iii) EU Medical Device Regulation-related charges; (iv) intangible asset amortization expense; and (v) income tax impact from adjustments. The adjusted earnings per diluted share measure is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to diluted shares by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.   The measure of free cash flow consists of GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.   The adjusted free cash flow conversion measure is calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income.\n\nReconciliations of GAAP revenues to organic revenues and GAAP adjusted net income to adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income, and GAAP earnings per diluted share to adjusted earnings per diluted share all for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow conversion for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, appear in the financial tables in this release.\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of organic revenues and the other non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations.   For further information regarding why Integra believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures, and some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K regarding this earnings press release filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   This Current Report on Form 8-K is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.integralife.com.\n\nInvestor Relations Contact:\n\nChris Ward\r\n(609)

      "content": "Sales of $1,655 million, operating profit of $162 million and adjusted operating profit of $211 million in fourth quarter 2022 Fourth quarter price realization of $135 million. Net price-cost tailwind of $80 million in fourth quarter 2022 Record high backlog of $4.8 billion provides good visibility into top-line growth projections for 2023 Fourth quarter financial performance provides momentum for strong 2023. Expect 2023 net sales growth of 15%, operating profit of $568 million to $618 million and adjusted operating profit of $750 million to $800 million, up 76% at the midpoint of guidance compared to 2022\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio, February 22, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE: VRT), a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Vertiv reported fourth quarter net sales of $1,655 million, an increase of $244 million, or 17.3%, compared with last year’s fourth quarter and a 22.0% organic net sales increase(1), which excludes the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures. Foreign currency negatively impacted fourth quarter sales by approximately $90 million from last year’s fourth quarter. As anticipated, due to a very challenging comparison, orders adjusted for foreign exchange declined 15% in fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter and increased 7% sequentially compared to third quarter 2022 – signifying that our end markets remain healthy as the absolute value of orders booked remains high. Backlog at the end of 2022 was $4.8 billion, an increase of 49% from the end of 2021.\n\nFourth quarter operating profit of $162 million increased $166 million as compared with the prior year fourth quarter, and adjusted operating profit of $211 million increased $117 million from the same period. These increases were driven by benefits received from pricing and volume, and were partially offset by material and freight inflation, foreign exchange and one-time fixed cost benefits realized in fourth quarter 2021. Fourth quarter price realization of $135 million was consistent with our October guidance, and our full year 2022 price realization of $365 million was consistent with our beginning of the year guidance. Price-cost was positive $80 million in the fourth quarter, and all regions were positive price-cost for the quarter. While fourth quarter 2022 adjusted operating profit was below the October guidance range primarily due to the COVID-19 outbreak in China and E&I performance, which was partially offset by less foreign exchange impact, Vertiv’s run-rate performance in the fourth quarter firmly supports Vertiv’s current 2023 outlook, as discussed below.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"2022 was a pivotal and transformative year for Vertiv that culminated in our best quarter ever, with strong year-over-year and sequential growth in revenue, operating profit, margins, cash flow and a record backlog,\" said Giordano Albertazzi, Vertiv’s Chief Executive Officer. \"Supply chain pressures are easing, pricing continues to improve, and we have made steady progress in the Americas with operating margins in that segment rebounding to over 20% in the fourth quarter. While cautious about an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, we continue to see healthy demand in our end markets and are confident in our positive outlook for 2023. By prudently managing costs, maintaining a laser-sharp focus on operational execution, efficiency and building a high-performance culture, we are positioning Vertiv for sustained long-term growth and value creation.\"\n\nDave Cote, Vertiv’s Executive Chairman, added: \"After a challenging end to 2021, in February we laid out a strategic framework for strengthening our supply chain, addressing cost pressures and operational challenges in the Americas, and advancing our aggressive pricing plan to drive margin improvement and enhanced profitability. Each quarter showed marked sequential improvement, and our fourth quarter financial results demonstrate the meaningful progress we have made in executing our strategy. Under Gio’s leadership, we made rapid and visible progress in turning around the Americas. Now as CEO, he and his leadership team are applying that same rigor across the entire organization to deliver improved performance and profitability in 2023 and beyond.\"\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow and Liquidity\n\nNet cash generated by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $181 million, an increase of $144 million from the prior year quarter, and adjusted free cash flow was $143 million, an increase of $135 million from the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow, while significantly positive, was below the guidance range primarily due to timing of shipments and associated collections, delayed collections in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and higher inventory balances due to supply chain challenges with certain components. We remain committed to a significant improvement in adjusted free cash flow for 2023, as reflected in our guidance, which we anticipate will be driven by improved profitability and optimized working capital programs already underway. Liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter was $578 million.\n\nFull Year and First Quarter 2023 Guidance\n\nWe believe that our strong fourth quarter 2022 financial results position us well for 2023. We anticipate 2023 organic net sales growth of 15%, supported by our backlog. Although the macro-economic environment remains uncertain, our backlog gives us good visibility to a strong sales trajectory for 2023. Our 2023 guidance assumes price realization of $275 million, which includes $200 million of carryover price, and an overall price-cost tailwind of $100 million versus the prior year. We will continue to invest in R&D and capacity expansions, with an incremental investment of $40 million planned for 2023. Our full-year guidance for adjusted operating profit is up over 75%, and adjusted operating margin is up 430 basis points versus 2022. Adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2023 is $300 million to $400 million, a $610 million anticipated improvement (at the midpoint) year over year driven by improved profitability and substantially less cash used for working capital as optimization programs take hold.\n\nFirst Quarter 2023 Guidance Net sales $1,350M - $1,450M Organic net sales growth(2) 21% - 29% Adjusted operating profit $115M – $135M Adjusted operating margin(2) 8.5% - 9.3% Adjusted diluted EPS(1) $0.14 - $0.20 Adjusted Free Cash Flow(2) ($100M) – ($50M)\n\nFull Year 2023 Guidance Net sales $6,450M - $6,600M Organic net sales growth(2) 14% - 17% Adjusted operating profit $750M - $800M Adjusted operating margin(2) 11.7% - 12.3% Adjusted diluted EPS(1) $1.17 - $1.27 Adjusted Free Cash Flow(2) $300M - $400M\n\n(1) This release contains certain non-GAAP metrics.

Vertiv has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in the news release, as further described above, that may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies. These non-GAAP financial measures include organic net sales growth (including on a segment basis), adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted free cash flow, which management believes provides investors with useful supplemental information to evaluate the Company’s ongoing operations and to compare with past and future periods. Management also uses certain non-GAAP measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring its operating performance. These measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, Vertiv has provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nInformation reconciling certain forward-looking GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures related to first quarter and full-year 2023 guidance, including organic net sales growth, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin, is not available without unreasonable effort due to high variability, complexity and uncertainty with respect to forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. For the same reasons, we are unable to compute the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nSee \"Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release for Vertiv’s reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release, and other statements that Vertiv may make in connection therewith, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to Vertiv’s future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations, and as such are not historical facts.

      "content": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its “Baron Partners Fund” fourth quarter 2022 investor letter. A copy of the same can bedownloaded here. Through the first nine months of the year, the fund modestly outperformed the Russel Midcap Growth Index. The last quarter caused the fund’s absolute and relative annual performance to be meaningfully lower than its long-term average. The fund declined 19.94% in the fourth quarter compared to the Russell Midcap Growth Index’s 6.90% return. For the calendar year, the fund returned -42.41% compared to a -26.72% return for the Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.\n\nBaron Partners Fund highlighted stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the fourth quarter 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle and energy generation and storage systems manufacturer. On February 21, 2023, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock closed at $197.37 per share. One-month return of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was 36.65%, and its shares lost 22.50% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a market capitalization of $624.498 billion.\n\nBaron Partners Fund made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\"Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) declined 54% in the quarter and detracted 26.62% from the Fund’s overall performance. We initiated our position in Tesla in February 2014 at a split-adjusted price of $11.91. Over the subsequent two years, we acquired 16.65 million shares for an average split-adjusted price of $14.22. At the time of our final purchase in February 2016, the stock represented 9.6% of the Fund’s total investments.\n\nTesla produced approximately 35,000 vehicles in 2014, the year of our initial purchase. In 2022, it produced 1.37 million vehicles. Not only has its production grown tremendously, but it has also significantly increased profitability per vehicle. Tesla has expanded from producing high performance electric vehicles for wealthy aficionados to a company that produces affordable luxury cars for a sizable audience. In turn, it has transformed its industry. Investors rewarded this expansion in both production and profits, and the stock price increased to $265.25 at the end of the third quarter. Since 2016, we sold 4.5 million shares, or 27.0% of the original holding, at an average price of $218.39.\n\nInvestors have recently become concerned about many external factors. Elon Musk is Tesla’s founder and CEO. His purchase of Twitter has negatively impacted the perception of Tesla’s brand in the short term. China’s COVID policies and outbreak have paused purchases and production in the company’s largest region. Global recessionary fears and upcoming Inflation Reduction Act incentives also caused some to delay new vehicle purchases in various markets…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues top 10 car company stocks to invest in\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nTesla, Inc.

(Operator Instructions) Please stand by for your first question -- our first question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.\n\nMatthew Gregory Hewitt\n\nThank you for all the details and the update. Maybe first up, Bobby, could you describe what the sales environment is like? Obviously, the last couple of years has been pretty challenging. Hospitals reluctant to maybe bring in new software, given some of the challenges they were facing with COVID, it seems that that's freeing up. Now you've got some issues on the hiring and retention side at hospitals, but maybe just a little bit of color on what you're seeing from the customer side.\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nYes. I think probably the simplest way to say is that our products are well aligned with business needs, but the larger customer base is under a lot of financial duress. I think 2022 is probably one of the most difficult financial times for -- take acute care hospitals in a long time.\n\nMatthew Gregory Hewitt\n\nThat's really helpful. And maybe a follow-up. Getting a little more specific with the Ardent win, obviously, congratulations there. Maybe if you could provide a little bit of detail on how long was that deal in the pipeline. Who are they -- what were they using prior to converting over to hStream and the learning center? And how long was that deal in the pipeline? How long did it take to get to close that one given some of the challenges that the customers are facing?\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nWell, sure. Will that one moved along fairly well over the course of the year from initiation of discussion was that they were going to look to the market to see what was available. They are on a competing application suite. And so it was a change for them to move to us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nRichard Collamer Close\n\nCongratulations and thanks for the question. Bobby, maybe just to build on some of the comments you just made to Matt's question. With respect to revenue growth in the first half, should that be somewhat flattish and then seeing the growth -- most of the growth in the second half of the year? Just curious...\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nFair question. I don't think it's going to -- we do think more -- in some areas, the business will matriculate in the second half. But that said, like the learning platform is going live at Arden, and we'll get to those revenues sooner, for example. So I think the year will show growth. I haven't looked at its quarterization in the last 24 hours, I can't quite remember the ups and downs on it.\n\nScott Alexander Roberts\n\nYes. I think, Richard, it will -- won't be quite as dramatic as last year where we had a 2% first half and a 6% second half kind of growth rate, I think it will be a little bit more balanced than that, but I would expect, just given some of the way revenue strength flows in over time, that the second half will be a little more pronounced than the first half, but probably not as big as a gap as we saw last year.\n\nRichard Collamer Close\n\nOkay. And then considering you guys just posted 6.5% growth, I guess, in the fourth quarter. So you would gauge that for the year, the 4% to 6% is baking in some conservatism just basically because the current environment is uncertain.\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nWell, there's definitely a little of that, but I don't know if I'd call it conservative. It is our best estimate based on all the variables. It really is. I don't think we're trying to be overly conservative or overly aggressive. It's just kind of when we look at our pipelines, how they're converting. We looked at our fourth quarter sales, obviously very important to have some nice big wins there to know how they'll roll in.\n\nRichard Collamer Close\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then when I think about something like the cloud CME acquisition earlier or midyear, I guess, and then the Eeds here recently, not huge from a revenue contribution, but how easy or hard is the process in terms of plugging that into the those offerings into the platform -- and then just like cross-selling that into your significant base. Is that something where the sales process is relatively easy? Just any thoughts on that front?\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nYes. It's a great opportunity to kind of talk about the platform a little bit more and create more clarity on it and how to best think about it for the next, say, 12 months. And so the first thing to remember the actual platform itself, the technology of the platform is growing and maturing as reflected in the actual release of our developer portal on our first set of publicly available licensable APIs and the Kaiser deal we just announced. So we're really excited about that. And each time we add to that platform, the actual technology capability of the platform things will get faster, easier and better.\n\nRichard Collamer Close\n\nNo, that's fine. I actually got to a couple of questions I had in my back pocket here. My final question, if I can ask another one, is on the digital network development business. So just if maybe you could describe that a little bit better exactly what that is and how we should think about understanding the financial opportunity longer term there?\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nScott, do you want to take that for a second?\n\nScott Alexander Roberts\n\nSure. Richard, so this new solution group be led by Scott McQuigg, as Bobby mentioned on the call. This is a kind of forming a solution group around the individuals versus the businesses that we've traditionally done work with over the years. And so trying to target that audience more discretely and specifically. And so an example of applications that already have as assets or NurseGrid and My Clinical Exchange, both from prior acquisitions. So continuing to invest in those technologies to get more of the footprint directly with the individuals at our end users in health care. So that will play out over time. Obviously, just kind of putting more attention to it as we head into 2023.\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nRichard, just building on that. I love -- we kind of coined this internal phrase turning subscriptions into subscribers. If you think of the $5.4-plus million subscription licenses that we sold to hStream, Scott McQuigg new job is to try to find those individuals as individual consumers over time. So for example, we have lots of -- through a few visionary statements out there that, again, haven't occurred, but they're in front of us under Scott McQuigg leadership.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jared Haase with William Blair & Company.\n\nJared Phillip Haase\n\nI guess you talked a lot about some of the sort of product experience synergies from having the interoperability across the single platform. In the release, you also mentioned sort of branding and contracting being consolidated as part of the single platform strategy as well.\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nOh, gosh. I hope it's both. We're early to making these changes, obviously, and some of them were position changes. But I do think I mean, obviously, for a while of necessity, we operate a separate wholly owned company, and it had its own infrastructure and its own thought and it had to be built out and become market-leading, the VerityStream company led by Michael Sousa.\n\nJared Phillip Haase\n\nMake sense. And then I think maybe just a related follow-up, but specific to the guidance. So looking at the 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion that's embedded in the 23 outlook, I'm curious how much of that is -- would you say is directly related to some of the operational efficiencies that you announced in tandem with this inflection point of the single platform?\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nI'll let Scott address that. I mean there's obviously a little bit of both contributing. And clearly, when you delayer parts of your business where you have duplication of leadership, it creates some -- a more immediate financial leverage, so it certainly is important to the impact.\n\nScott Alexander Roberts\n\nYes, Jared, I think without trying to get into specifics of quantifying it, I think that we do expect some of those synergies to flow through to improve EBITDA. But we're also planning to look for increasing investment in some areas where we need to, like in the hStream platform and I think I mentioned our scheduling application and then this new area that we just mentioned on digital and network development.\n\nJared Phillip Haase\n\nBack in the queue and congrats on all the updates.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Vincent Colicchio with Barrington Research.\n\nVincent Alexander Colicchio\n\nYes, Bobby, I'm curious, will there be any meaningful changes in how the sales force is organized and operates?\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nNot now and nothing is immediately planned. We've kind of built out the sales force the way we like it last year, and it's broken between account management strategies. I do think the -- well, as I said that I'm thinking through, I think that as a result of merging in VerityStream, things like the account management teams will take on slightly new probably account assignments. We'll think of them again as one set of customers, set of 2 set of customers.\n\nVincent Alexander Colicchio\n\nAnd how did cross-selling how did it perform in the quarter versus your expectation?\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nWell, I mean I gave those 4 examples to show, I think, how we're emerging. You saw prime health care go from being just a learning customer to being a learning and now an enterprise scheduling customer. And so I think it would be our plan to continue that journey to show that in these 3 application areas, we are the best of breed and to show they're increasingly interoperable and increasingly leverageable. They improve efficiencies when you have more than one of our applications.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Robert Frist for closing remarks.\n\nRobert A. Frist\n\nWell, I was so glad to get to the part where I can kind of add live and answer your questions because there was so much change in the quarter from the dividend, Eddie Pearson's I guess, I'll call it semi-retirement to the structural changes, and the branding changes, that I was told to say on scripts. So you've probably got a little sense that I was reading, reading, reading and so I kind of was it was fun to get to your questions and answer them.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call.

      "content": "IDEX BIOMETRICS ASA\n\nOslo, Norway – 22 February 2023 - IDEX Biometrics ASA’s interim report for the fourth quarter and preliminary annual result for 2022 is attached to this notice (link below). The interim report is also available on the IDEX Biometrics website: www.idexbiometrics.com/investors/interim-results/\n\nA webcast presentation of the interim report will be held by Vince Graziani, Chief Executive Officer, today at 13:00 CET. The webcast presentation can be viewed at the following link:\n\nhttps://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/hegnarmedia/20230223_5/\n\n2022 marked an inflection point in the biometric payment card market with nine new biometric payment card programs launched with banks on the IDEX Biometrics technology platform. This indicates an acceleration in the deployment of biometric cards with banks and issuers and commercial success for card manufacturers who have selected IDEX Biometrics sensor solutions over the competition.\n\nUntil recently, there were four biometric card manufacturers in the market with cards based on IDEX Biometrics sensor technology. In 2022, IDEX Biometrics significantly accelerated design wins with card manufacturers, reaching twelve design wins with global and regional card manufacturers across the globe. These card manufacturers are in the process of obtaining LOA’s (Letters Of Approval) from the major payment schemes and are preparing to launch biometric smart cards based on the certified IDEX Biometrics and Infineon Technologies solution offering, together with global and regional banks and issuers.\n\nRevenues in the fourth quarter were $1.1 million, increasing 15% compared to third quarter revenues of $928 thousand. For the full year the company recorded revenues of $4.1 million, a year-over-year increase of 44%. We expect continued revenue growth in 2023.\n\nGross margin increased to 33% in the fourth quarter, up from 12% in the third quarter, and for the full year 2022 the gross margin was 21%. The higher margin in the fourth quarter was due to increased sales to high-margin customers. We expect the gross margin in the first quarter of 2023 to be at similar levels as in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating expenses excluding cost of materials and depreciation decreased 12% this quarter to $7.0, down from $7.9 million in the third quarter. The decrease in operating expenses partly reflects a reduction of the number of employees implemented in the second half of 2022. Development expenses were seasonally low in the fourth quarter due to recognition of government support credits. We expect to further decrease operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFor further information contact:\r\nMarianne Bøe, Head of Investor Relations\r\n E-mail: marianne.boe@idexbiometrics.com\r\n Tel: + 47 918 00186\n\nAbout IDEX Biometrics\n\nIDEX Biometrics ASA (OSE: IDEX and Nasdaq: IDBA) is a global technology leader in fingerprint biometrics, offering authentication solutions across payments, access control, and digital identity to create unmatched convenience and uncompromised security for users.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Westlake Chemical Partners' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 21, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to today's host, Jeff Holy, Westlake Chemical Partners' Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJeff Holy\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Westlake Chemical Partners Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. I'm joined today by Albert Chao, our President and CEO; Steve Bender, our Executive Vice President and CFO and other members of our management team.\n\nAlbert Yuan Chao\n\nThank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. In this morning's press release, we reported Westlake Partners full year 2022 net income of $64 million or $1.82 per unit. Our consolidated net income, including OpCo was $335 million for the full year 2022.\n\nMark Steven Bender\n\nThank you, Albert, and good afternoon, everyone. In this morning's press release, we reported Westlake Partners' fourth quarter 2022 net income of $17 million or $0.48 per unit. Consolidated net income, including OpCo's earnings was $91 million on consolidated net sales of $367 million. The Partnership had distributable cash flow for the quarter of $20 million or $0.58 per unit. Fourth quarter 2022 net income for Westlake Partners of $17 million decreased by $13 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 net income of $30 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbert Yuan Chao\n\nThank you, Steve. We are pleased with the Partnership's financial and operational performance through the fourth quarter and the year as a whole. The stability of our business model and associated cash flows demonstrate the benefit of our ethylene sales agreement and its protective provisions provide the Partnership through predictable long-term earnings and cash flows despite both planned and unplanned production outages.\n\nJeff Holy\n\nThank you, Albert. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind you that a replay of this teleconference will be available 2 hours after the call has ended. We will provide that number again at the end of the call. Michelle, we will now take questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from James [R. Shaw] with [Avian] Advisory.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nA couple of questions. You mentioned that you are going to have 1 -- (inaudible) outage. Is that the right word for one of your facilities this year?\n\nMark Steven Bender\n\nSo it will be a maintenance turnaround.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nOkay. What will be -- what -- do you have an estimate of what the impact on net -- or operating income and EBITDA and cash flow will be?\n\nMark Steven Bender\n\nAnd so because we have that contract, that ethylene contract with our parent Westlake Corporation, we'll be losing that -- those pounds that are subject to that 95% offtake at that $0.10 margin. The turnaround is expected to last 30 days, and we'll update as we get closer, but that turnaround is expected to start in May.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nOkay. The next, why did third-party margins decline? And do you have any outlook for this year as to what's going to happen with the third-party margins?\n\nMark Steven Bender\n\nSo third-party margins were depressed in the quarter simply because of lack of demand of ethylene derivatives in the marketplace. We're selling ethylene into that market. And so there was a pullback as you've seen in the macroeconomic environment for ethylene-related derivatives.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nSo if they're below that threshold, does that mean you just won't make the sales?\n\nMark Steven Bender\n\nWe'll make sales, but we'll certainly be opportunistic when we find markets that are attractive to us. Certainly, we'll look to see if we can optimize, but we are interested in making those third-party sales because they are contributory to net income during the course of the year.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nOkay. And I don't want to take so much of your time, but I did notice that you had a meaningful decline in SG&A expenses quarter-on-quarter and a less pronounced decline year-on-year. What -- why did that happen?\n\nMark Steven Bender\n\nYes. From time to time, we have peaks and valleys in some of the maintenance activities and time to time, we have changes in timing as it relates to some of the expenses, administratively. So I would say that if you look at over the course of a year, it does tend to average out, but there are some peaks and valleys in terms of when certain administrative costs are incurred, and we have certain activities at the plant site that occur -- that impact G&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, the Q&A session has now ended.

      "title": "Harju Elekter Group financial results, 1-12/2022",
      "content": "HARJU ELEKTER AS\n\nThe fourth quarter and year of Harju Elekter are marked by record revenues, increasing by almost 15% compared to previous periods. Annual revenue of 175.3 (2021: 152.8) million euros exceeds the Group’s turnover record achieved last year. The growth in sales volumes has been supported by sustained customer relationships based on long-term reliable cooperation. However, by the end of a difficult crisis year, the first loss in company history had to be absorbed. We managed to improve the financial results in the second half of the year, but despite our efforts, we had to make one-time significant reserves and write-offs, which did not allow us to make a profit. Without one-time costs, the operating profit for the last quarter would have been 0.4 (2021 Q4: 0.9) and the second half operating profit would have been 2.5 (2021 II half: 2.0) million euros.\n\nWe have laid a solid foundation for 2023 and will continue with the process of creating a cohesively functioning Harju Elekter Group. We have modern factories and equipment in Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, and Sweden. In Västerås a new production building of 6,300 m² was completed at the end of the year, which is the latest addition to our industrial real estate portfolio. With the completion of our modern factory, we decided to consolidate the various units of our Swedish subsidiary in Västerås, to ensure savings and a more cohesive and stronger local unit.\n\nThe Group has good liquidity and capitalisation, as well as a strong governance structure. In the last quarter of the year, we established a group management team comprised of experts and began the more centralised management of companies, especially in financial management-control, production-supply chain, and sales-marketing. Harju Elekter’s strategy, which is integrated with sustainability goals, will focus on increasing the sales volumes and profitability of industrial production and projects in the coming years.\n\nRevenue and financial results\n\nHarju Elekter earned revenue of 50.0 (2021 Q4: 43.6) million euros in the reporting quarter and 175.3 (2021: 152.8) million in the reporting year. Compared to the comparable periods, the quarterly and annual revenue growth was 14.7% and 14.8%. The majority of the increase in consolidated revenue in the reporting quarter was due to the increase in sales of low-voltage equipment, substations and electric car chargers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEUR ’000 Q4 Q4 +/- 12M 12M +/- 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue 49,978 43,561 14.7% 175,293 152,757 14.8% Gross profit 2,517 4,703 -46.5% 12,269 17,880 -31.4% EBITDA -943 1,939 -148.6% 217 7,220 -97.% Operating profit/loss (-) (EBIT) -2,063 853 -341.9% -4,546 3,202 -242.% Profit/loss (-) for the period -2,482 894 -377.6% -5,567 2,610 -313.3% Incl. attributable to owners of the parent company -2,520 888 -383.8% -5,544 2,598 -313.4% Earnings per share (EPS) (euros) -0.14 0.05 -380.% -0.31 0.15 -306.7%\n\nThe Group's operating expenses totalled 51.9 (2021 Q4: 42.8) million euros in the reporting quarter and 179.8 (2021: 149.8) million in the reporting year. The majority of the increase in operating expenses was due to the increase in the cost of sales respectively, 22.1% in the quarter and 20.9% in the year. The growth rate of costs of sales exceeded the growth rate of revenue by 7.4 and 6.1 percentage points, respectively, in the comparison of the fourth quarters and years.\n\nDistribution costs increased by 0.2 million to 1.4 million euros compared to the fourth quarter the year before, making up 2.8% of the Group's operating expenses and 2.9% of revenue. Administrative expenses increased by 0.4 million euros to 3.0 million euros year-on-year, making up 5.8% of the Group's operating expenses and 6.1% of the revenue. The total distribution costs for 2022 were 5.6 (2021: 5.3) and general administration costs were 11.1 (2021: 9.7) million euros. The write-down of the goodwill of Energo Veritas OÜ in the value of 0.4 million euros was included in the administrative expenses of the financial year, which also affected the annual depreciation of non-current assets.\n\nIn a quarterly comparison, labour costs increased by 8.7%, amounting to 9.1 million euros. In yearly comparison, labour costs increased by 3.8 million, being 34.4 million euros. A majority of the growth in labour costs and average wages was attributed to the significant increase in staff and to wage pressure due to labour shortages in all markets.\n\nThe gross profit for the fourth quarter was 2,517 (2021 Q4: 4,703) thousand euros and the gross profit margin was 5.0% (2021 Q4: 10.8%). Operating loss (EBIT) was -2,063 (2021 Q4: operating profit 853) thousand euros. The operating margin of the fourth quarter was -4.1% (2021 Q4: 2.0%). The net loss for the reporting quarter was -2,482 (2021 Q4: net profit 894) thousand euros, of which the share of the owners of the parent company was -2,520 (2021 Q4: 888) thousand euros. Net loss per share in the last quarter was -0.14 (2021 Q4: net profit per share 0.05) euros. The result of the fourth quarter was most affected by a one-time expense of 1.0 million euros of inventory write-down and an increase of the provision to cover unprofitable contracts by 1.5 million euros. The gross profit for 2022 was 12,269 (2021: 17,880) thousand euros and the gross profit margin was 7.0% (2021: 11.7%). The difficult year brought Harju Elekter a first operating loss (EBIT) of -4,546 (2021: operating profit 3,202) and a net loss of -5,567 (2021: net profit 2,610) thousand euros. Net loss per share was -0.31 (2021: net profit per share 0.15) euros.\n\nCore business and markets\n\nThe production segment accounted for 92.5% of the revenue for the quarter and 89.9% of the revenue for 2022. The revenue of the production segment increased by 22.7% in the reporting quarter and by 18.0% during the year, being 46.2 and 157.6 million euros, respectively.\n\nSales to the Estonian market was 7.6 (2021 Q4: 6.5) in the reporting quarter and 30.3 (2021: 26.0) million euros in the reporting year, making up 15.2% and 17.3% of the consolidated revenue, respectively (2021 Q4 and 12M: 15.0% and 17.0%). The growth came mainly from the increase in the sales volume of substations and cable distribution cabinets.\n\nIn the reporting quarter, revenue from the Finnish market was 18.7% more than the year before, totaling 21.3 million euros. In 2022, with 81.8 (2021: 70.9) million euros earned, the Finnish market grew the most in monetary value compared to the main markets. In the reporting quarter, 42.5% (2021 Q4: 41.1%) and within the reporting year 46.7% (2021: 46.4%) of Harju Elekter products and services were sold to the Group's largest market.\n\nSales to the Swedish market decreased by 31.8% compared to the reporting quarters and by 17.3% compared to twelve months, being 7.0 and 22.8 million euros, respectively. The benchmark for the Swedish market was high, as the Swedish subsidiary had more projects underway than usual in the local market in the same period last year. Sweden accounted 14.2% (2021 Q4: 23.8%) of the consolidated revenue of the reporting quarter and 13.0% (2021: 18.1%) of the year 2022 revenue.\n\nThe fourth quarter's revenue from the Norwegian market doubled compared to the previous year, amounting to 8.9 (2021 Q4: 4.2) million euros. The revenue earned in 2022 from the Norwegian market was 21.8 million euros, which is 65.4% more than the previous year. The increase in revenue in both periods is due to the low order volume of the shipping sector in the comparison period. The Norwegian market accounted for 17.8% (2021 Q4: 9.7%) of the consolidated revenue of the reporting quarter and 12.4% (2021: 8.6%) of the annual revenue.\n\nInvestments\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Group invested a total of 15.2 (2021: 7.7) million euros in non-current assets, incl 1.8 (2021: 1.3) million euros in investment properties, 12.9 (2021: 5.7) million euros in property, plant, and equipment and 0.5 (2021: 0.7) million euros in intangible assets. In the last quarter, the Swedish subsidiary acquired a real estate company, LC Development Fastigheter 17 AB, which was created specifically for the construction of the Västerås factory. The total acquisition price of the land and building was 10.5 million euros. During the previous quarters, most of the investments were directed to the construction of the Laohotell III production and warehouse complex, in the Allika Industrial Park, which today is filled with tenants. In addition, investments were made in production technology equipment, production and process management systems, renovating buildings and a plot of land was acquired in Finland.\n\nThe value of the Group's non-current financial investments totalled 23.7 (31.12.21: 25.2) million euros as of the reporting date. Harju Elekter increased its holding in the technology company IGL-Technologies Oy from 5.5% to 10% by 0.2 million euros and sold a 14% holding in SIA Energokomplekss, to focus on its core business.\n\nShare\n\nThe company's share price on the last trading day of the reporting quarter on the Nasdaq Tallinn Stock Exchange closed at 5.01 euros. As of 31 December 2022, AS Harju Elekter had 10,584 shareholders. The number of shareholders increased during the reporting quarter by 417.\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Unaudited EUR '000 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 ASSETS Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 9,152 574 Trade and other receivables 31,612 33,689 Prepayments 1,126 1,844 Inventories 37,068 27,437 Total current assets 79,958 63,544 Non-current assets Deferred income tax assets 1,008 690 Non-current financial investments 23,731 25,222 Investment properties 24,756 23,903 Property, plant and equipment 35,740 26,654 Intangible assets 7,244 7,544 Total non-current assets 92,479 84,013 TOTAL ASSETS 171,437 147,557 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Liabilities Borrowings 24,385 16,912 Prepayments from customers 16,827 4,659 Trade and other payables 24,502 24,490 Tax liabilities 3,478 3,156 Current provisions 2,103 35 Total current liabilities 71,295 49,252 Borrowings 20,732 11,426 Other non-current liabilities 33 Total non-current liabilities 20,732 11,459 TOTAL LIABILITIES 92,027 60,711 Equity Share capital 11,523 11,352 Share premium 2,509 1,601 Reserves 17,768 18,716 Retained earnings 47,771 55,315 Total equity attributable to the owners of the parent company 79,571 86,984 Non-controlling interests -161 -138 Total equity 79,410 86,846 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY 171,437 147,557\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF PROFIT AND LOSS Unaudited EUR '000 Q4 Q4 12M 12M 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue 49,978 43,561 175,293 152,757 Cost of sales -47,461 -38,858 -163,024 -134,877 Gross profit 2,517 4,703 12,269 17,880 Distribution costs - 1,449 - 1,260 -5,578 -5,259 Administrative expenses -3,037 -2,655 -11,194 -9,703 Other income 9 114 351 513 Other expenses -103 -49 -394 -229 Operating profit/loss (-) -2,063 853 -4,546 3,202 Finance income 48 57 122 129 Finance costs -476 -101 -853 -353 Profit/loss (-) before tax -2,491 809 -5,277 2,978 Income tax 9 85 -290 -368 Profit/loss (-) for the period -2,482 894 -5,567 2,610 Profit /loss (-) attributable to: Owners of the parent company -2,520 888 -5,544 2,598 Non-controlling interests 38 6 -23 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share (euros) -0.14 0.05 -0.31 0.15 Diluted earnings per share (euros) -0.14 0.05 -0.30 0.14\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVEINCOME Unaudited EUR '000 Q4 Q4 12M 12M 2022 2021 2022 2021 Profit/loss (-) for the period -2,482 894 -5,567 2,610 Other comprehensive income Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss Impact of exchange rate changes of a foreign subsidiaries -47 -44 -208 -57 Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss Gain on sales of financial assets 320 265 Net gain/loss (-) on revaluation of financial assets 20 3,900 -726 12,269 Total comprehensive income for the period -27 3,856 -614 12,477 Other comprehensive income -2,509 4,750 -6,181 15,087 Total comprehensive income attributable to: Owners of the Company -2,547 4,744 -6,158 15,075 Non-controlling interests 38 6 -23 12\n\nTiit Atso\r\nChairman of the Board\r\n+372 674 7400\n\nAttachment\n\nHE Interim Report Q4 2022",

Deck; President, CEO & Director; John Bean Technologies Corporation\n\nKedric Meredith; VP of Corporate Development & IR; John Bean Technologies Corporation\n\nMatthew J. Meister; Executive VP & CFO; John Bean Technologies Corporation\n\nLawrence Tighe De Maria; Co-Group Head of Global Industrial Infrastructure; William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nWalter Scott Liptak; MD & Senior Industrials Analyst; Seaport Research Partners\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, and welcome to JBT Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I'll now turn the call over to JBT's Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Kedric Meredith to begin today's conference.\n\nKedric Meredith\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end 2022 conference call. With me on the call is our Chief Executive Officer, Brian Deck and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Meister.\n\nBrian A. Deck\n\nThanks, Kedric, and good morning, everyone. JBT captured double-digit growth on the top and bottom line for 2022, notwithstanding the much discussed challenges associated with rapid inflation and supply chain disruptions.\n\nMatthew J. Meister\n\nThanks, Brian. JBT delivered solid double-digit revenue and earnings growth in 2022. Total revenue increased 16% and adjusted EBITDA grew 11% year-over-year. Earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% and 18%, respectively.\n\nBrian A. Deck\n\nThanks, Matt. As I stated at the top of the call, we were encouraged by the pace of fourth quarter orders. FoodTech orders of $432 million were up 24% sequentially, exceeding our expectations with improvements in Europe and Asia. And despite price weakness and pressure affecting our customers in the poultry industry, we also experienced some order improvement in North America as a result of JBT's highly diverse product portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\n\nWalter Scott Liptak\n\nThanks for the clarification about AeroTech and the timing. I just wanted to make sure I understood it that it sounds like it's a sale is more likely? Is that an all-in-one transaction? And I think you said that the timing might be in the second half. So does that mean an announcement in the first half and closing the deal in the second half or something different?\n\nBrian A. Deck\n\nEssentially, yes. It's more likely it's going to be a sale. And of course, ideally, it would be in full, right? That would be -- we think that the platform value of AeroTech is more than the sum of its parts. Therefore, we do feel that that's certainly the better path. And in terms of timing, you essentially have it. We'll provide more detail here in the second quarter and then thereafter, look to execute and transact in the back half.\n\nWalter Scott Liptak\n\nOkay. All right. Great. And I wonder if you could just provide a little bit more detail about what you're seeing from the poultry market. And primarily, it looks like the CapEx plans are still on track. But just what you're seeing, is there a delay that's happening or is it just a timing issue?\n\nBrian A. Deck\n\nYes. As you've seen probably from the poultry industry, it's a bit of a challenging time right now in terms of profitability. We are heavily engaged with them. So orders were a little bit lower in the fourth quarter from them, but we were able to offset that with our diverse product offering. So that was good news. But what we do hear from them is that the need for automation, sustainability, productivity and even volume remains high on their list and the pipeline remains quite strong with them.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from John Joyner with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nIt's (inaudible) on for John Joyner. So my question primarily relates to the FoodTech, end of the line solutions which kind of seems like a large market opportunity for growth for JBT. Can you talk about some of the white space here and maybe areas that JBT can fill out through its capabilities.\n\nBrian A. Deck\n\nYes, absolutely. The end of line is indeed a very large opportunity. As you know, we invested in 2019 in our Proseal acquisition as well as our ACS, AutoCoding solutions on that side as well. When you think about packaging in general, everything ends up being packaged, right, in one way, shape or form, whether it's going to retail or if it's going to food service. So it is a very large market. We do -- it is a meaningful part of our M&A strategy as we go forward from here. So we do look forward as we continue to deploy capital as part of our strategic plan that we introduced in 2022 as we look to meet our 2025 targets. That is a nice space to be in.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Lawrence De Maria with William Blair.\n\nLawrence Tighe De Maria\n\nTwo questions. First question, obviously, 1Q is looking a little lighter than expected, which implies another big ramp throughout the year. Can you maybe just help us understand first half, second half split? Or maybe a little bit more around just some of the modeling to help us understand how big of a ramp we should expect into -- throughout the year of stocking stick?\n\nMatthew J. Meister\n\nSure, Larry. I think the first quarter, as you noted, is certainly a little bit lighter primarily because sort of seasonality that typically happens at JBT. As well as we had, as you can recall, a little lighter order volume in Q3 that impacted backlog for the first quarter. But certainly, I think our backlog as we enter into the year is actually pretty healthy for the remainder of the year. And we have visibility between backlog for the year as well as our very dependable recurring revenue streams to between 70% to 75% of the revenue for 2023.\n\nLawrence Tighe De Maria\n\nOkay. And then moving over to the AeroTech. I mean, can you give us any kind of color on initial thoughts on multiples, price talk? And what would post sale corporate look like?\n\nBrian A. Deck\n\nSure. In terms of multiples, Larry, we're going to let the market speak as to what the value is of that. Certainly, again, as I mentioned, it is an attractive asset as a whole. It's a platform business. So I think in terms of both -- it's going to generate interest from both strategic of -- strategic interest as well as the financial buyer space. So again, we're going to let the market speak for that.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\n\nBrian A. Deck\n\nGreat. Thank you. Yes. We understand it's a busy period for earnings announcement. So Kedric and Marlee are available for the rest of the day or for the week to take questions. Thanks very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

      "title": "SalMar - New industrial powerhouse established in the last quarter of 2022 after successful completion of the transactions with NTS, NRS and SalmoNor",
      "content": "SalMar ASA\n\nFourth quarter 2022 marked the end of an eventful year for SalMar with strategic moves which will further strengthen its position as leading provider of healthy and sustainable salmon. Q4 2022 resulted in a total operational EBIT for the group of NOK 1,006 million. Total harvest was 62,700 tonnes (NOK 16.05 per kg). Operational EBIT for Norway  was NOK 956 million with a harvest volume of 56,700 tonnes (NOK 16.86 per kg). Biological challenges affected results in Central Norway, while Northern Norway continued to deliver strong results. Sales and Industry recorded solid operational performance, with record high activity levels at its harvesting and processing plants. Continued good results from Icelandic Salmon with record high harvest volume. Weak results from Scottish Sea Farms due to biological challenges. Through a series of transactions with NTS, NRS and SalmoNor the results were consolidated in the group’s financials from November 2022. One-off costs related to the transactions at NOK 120 million affecting results in the fourth quarter. The company is performing a strategic review of ownership in Frøy ASA, with strong incoming interest. The board of directors has resolved to propose a dividend at the same level as in 2021 of NOK 20.00 per share for the financial year 2022. In Norway, the government has proposed resource tax on aquaculture with effect from the tax year 2023. If approved by parliament, the new tax will have major impact on the capacity for innovation and investments in the Norwegian aquaculture industry. SalMar delivered a thorough response in the public consultation process strongly opposing the proposed tax.\n\nRecord high harvest volume in the last quarter of 2022 and strong results for 2022\n\nNTS, NRS and SalmoNor were consolidated into SalMar with effect from November 2022. This is part of the reason why the group’s total harvested volumes reached 62,700 tonnes in the fourth quarter. Total operational EBIT for the group was NOK 1,006 million with an operational EBIT per kg of NOK 16.05.\n\nSalMar’s operational performance in Q4 was marked by continued solid performance in North Norway, strong capacity utilisation and solid operational performance in Sales and industry and record high harvest volumes in Iceland. Results in Central Norway, on the other hand, are weak due to biological challenges. And one-off costs related to the transactions at NOK 120 million affects the results in the fourth quarter.\n\n“Our committed and highly skilled employees have continued to deliver solid operational performance, but due to biological challenges it has been a quarter with mixed results for the group. The biological challenges in Central Norway were handled well event though it had negative effects in the period”, says SalMar’s CEO Frode Arntsen.\n\nFor 2022 total harvest volume for the group was 193,700 tonnes with an operational EBIT of NOK 4,465 million and operational EBIT per kg of NOK 23.05.\n\n“We have never delivered as much salmon to customers all over the world as we have done in 2022, this has resulted in a good financial result for the full year which is driven by strong operational performance and strong demand of salmon with consequently increased salmon prices”, continues Arntsen.\n\n2022 an eventful year that shapes our future\n\n“With the completion of the acquisitions of NTS, NRS and SalmoNor and addition of more than 500 new colleagues and significant investments along our entire existing value chain, SalMar has grown to become the world’s second largest salmon producer. We have created an even stronger foundation for growth in SalMar. We will continue our efforts to provide healthy and sustainable salmon and drive further improvements in our industry at sea and on land\", says Arntsen.\n\nIn 2023 the company will continue to invest in already sanctioned projects, but new investments are on hold in light of uncertainty around Norway’s tax proposal. In 2023 SalMar expects to invest NOK 2.1 billion.\n\n\"Both level and structure will divert investments from aquaculture in Norway to other countries and other industries. In addition the proposal will reduce the investment capital in Norway’s largest renewable export industry. This will strongly affect innovation power and investments on the Norwegian coast, the result will reduce the Norwegian industry and ownership and put Norwegian industrial workplaces and Norways position as the leader in the industry at risk. No other country has introduced a tax of this kind and at this level on its food production. It is still unclear to us what framework conditions we have to deal with two months into 2023, this is unsustainable for one of Norway's most important export industries\", says Arntsen.\n\n\"We submitted a clear consultation response at the beginning of January in which we clearly expressed our opinion and explained the negative effects of the tax proposal. The tax proposal is based on incorrect assumptions and should be permanently set aside like a broad majority did in the Norwegian Parliament three years ago\", continues Arntsen.\n\nExpect significant volume growth for SalMar in 2023, but low supply growth globally\n\nSalMar is firmly committed to continue to lead the industry and create sustainable growth and value on the terms of the salmon. The company builds its business and its future on a strong strategic and operational focus with dedicated employees and a unique corporate culture.\n\n“We see a large and untapped potential for improvement and growth in all parts of our business, not least in within our existing licenses. In the fourth quarter we have also implemented the operational structure for “new” SalMar in Norway, and we will during 2023 optimize our operations to take advantage of the potential we see in the acquisitions we have made,” says Arntsen.\n\nGrowth in supply for Atlantic salmon is expected to be low in 2023 globally. But due to the acquisitions SalMar expect a significant volume growth. For 2023, SalMar keeps its volume guidance for Norway at 243,000 tonnes and for Iceland at 16,000 tonnes. For Scotland, guidance is reduced to 37,000 tonnes.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2023, the company expects significantly lower volumes than in the previous quarter and a similar cost level. Contract share for the first quarter and full year 2023 will be around 25% and 10% respectively.\n\nThe complete report and presentation for the fourth quarter 2022 is attached.\n\nSalMar's CEO Frode Arntsen and CFO Ulrik Steinvik will present the company's results in Hotel Continental, Stortingsgata 24-26, Oslo, Norway today at 8am CET. The presentation will also be available on webcast on www.salmar.no.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nFrode Arntsen, CEO\r\n Tel: +47 482 06 665\r\n Email: frode.arntsen@salmar.no\n\nUlrik Steinvik, CFO\r\n Tel: +47 900 84 538\r\n Email: ulrik.steinvik@salmar.no\n\nHåkon Husby, Head of Investor Relations\r\n Tlf: +47 936 30 449\r\n Email: hakon.husby@salmar.no\n\nAbout SalMar\r\n SalMar is one of the world's largest and most efficient producers of salmon.

      "content": "Participants\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft; President, CEO & Director; The Manitowoc Company, Inc.\n\nBrian P. Regan; Executive VP & CFO; The Manitowoc Company, Inc.\n\nIon M. Warner; VP of Marketing & IR; The Manitowoc Company, Inc.\n\nJamie Lyn Cook; MD, Sector Head of United States Capital Goods Research and Analyst; Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division\n\nJerry David Revich; VP; Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\n\nSeth Robert Weber; Senior Equity Analyst; Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nStanley Stoker Elliott; VP & Analyst; Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nStephen Edward Volkmann; Equity Analyst; Jefferies LLC, Research Division\n\nSteven Fisher; Executive Director and Senior Analyst; UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nTami Zakaria; Analyst; JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Manitowoc Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is David, and I'll be your conference operator today. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ion Warner, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nIon M. Warner\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to the Manitowoc conference call to review the company's fourth quarter 2022 and full year 2022 financial results and business update as outlined in our press release yesterday. Participating on the call today are Aaron Ravenscroft, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Regan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nThank you, Ion, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 3. After a tough third quarter, I was really pleased with how our team rose to the occasion in the fourth quarter to deliver strong results despite significant adversity. As we entered the quarter, we felt confident that our shippable backlog and inventory levels would allow us to hit the low end of our guidance. The hard work of our team and a bit of luck with parts and vessel availability helped us end the year even stronger than we expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Please move to Slide 9. Beginning with orders, we exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter with orders of $708 million, an increase of 15% from a year ago. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and a couple of large dealer orders. This was partially offset by lower orders in our EURAF segment as a result of near-term uncertainty as previously discussed by Aaron. Foreign currency unfavorably impacted orders by $31 million. .\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nThank you, Brian. Looking forward, as Brian said, and I will reiterate, in the short term, we expect inflation, supply chain constraints and the impact from higher interest rates to be headwinds, which are included in our 2023 guidance.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJerry David Revich\n\nCongratulations on the quarter. Can I ask you, Aaron, to please expand the comments around the opportunity in the Middle East? What are your crane annualized revenues today? And what were they in the last peak just so we can dimensionalize what that investment cycle might look like here?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. I don't think you can compare the 2 cycles. They will be very different in nature. And normally, we don't give out that level of detail. But those projects are just beginning. They're moving dirt at this stage and they've got a lot of cranes on projects, but there's -- I don't think that we'll really start to see tenders come out until the fourth quarter of this year, so it's still early on.\n\nJerry David Revich\n\nOkay. Aaron, let me ask this way. So you're telling on crane renaissance as positive as I've heard you in terms of what's driving that level of optimism, how much of that is what you're seeing in North America, used values, aftermarket sales, et cetera, versus the opportunity in the Middle East and elsewhere. Can you just put that into context for us?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. I almost see it as a combination because I think that the stuff in the Middle East will come faster than what we're seeing in the U.S. I mean things are in decent shape in the United States at this point, but we really haven't seen any big change from the semiconductor or infrastructure bills and it's still very, very quiet. So I think it probably comes in waves, probably Middle East coming sooner than the U.S. But that being said, I think generally the stage is pretty well set in the U.S.\n\nJerry David Revich\n\nGot it. And in terms of the earnings cadence '23 versus '22, your earnings were pretty back-end loaded in '22. Is there a chance if the supply chain execution holds here that we might see a more balanced earnings performance first half of '23 versus back half of '23?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nI think it's too tough to comment on the second half at this stage. For sure, we're seeing a slowdown in the European tower crane business. So when you think about where our backlog goes, and , there's still a lot of question marks in the second half. But I agree with your comments on the part shortage issue. It's going to -- it's just as challenging. So I think it's going to be difficult to comment on cadence. What do you think, Brian?\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nYes. And I think we generally see Q1 a bit slower after the strong Q4 and then Q3 we have the seasonality related to Europe. So I still think that's going to be a part of it. And as Aaron mentioned, the other piece is just how the tower crane business shapes up for the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nSo I have a question on price cost. Can you tell us what price cost impact was in the quarter? And what your expectations are for this year?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. So the impact was about $8 million in the fourth quarter. And for next year, we still have about $30 million of clawback.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nGot it. So you expect to clawback the entirety of it this year?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nThat's the goal. But I think when you look at the pricing front at the moment, we're still on negotiations after all the price increases have been put forward. So we're going to just -- we're going to go after it. And I don't think it's as simple as just adding back the $30 million.\n\nTami Zakaria\n\nGot it. Okay. That's fair. And then in terms of your sales guide, any comments on what your price versus volume expectation is embedded in those -- in that number?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nBrian?\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nYes, I think the volume number overall is relatively flat year-over-year. So there's definitely some price in there. But there's a decent amount of mix change as well as we talked about relative to towers in particular.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Jamie Cook with Crédit Suisse.\n\nJamie Lyn Cook\n\nI guess first question, the non-machine sales increase that you saw in the year was fairly impressive. Can you talk to what your expectations are for 2023? And how we think about sort of that is a percentage of EBITDA or profit, just the business that tends to be more stable? So I guess that's my first question. If you could start there.\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. So I mean a big part of the driver last year was the acquisitions. Of course, we won't have those in terms of comps, but now we're pushing hard on organics while we try to line up the next acquisition. So -- and we look at it month over month over month sequentially, but it's going to be a lot more singles this year than the bump we had last year.\n\nJamie Lyn Cook\n\nOkay. And I guess my second question -- sorry, go ahead.\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nNo, I was going to say, you can think about it, like Aaron said, more organically growth. I mean the 22% that we saw in '22 was really driven by the acquisitions.\n\nJamie Lyn Cook\n\nOkay. And then just 2 quick follow-ups. Any expectation on cash flow for 2023? And then, Aaron, given some of the long-term favorable trends that could positively impact crane demand, what are you seeing at the dealer level in terms of inventory? Are they wanting to restock as they see some of these positive trends? And I'll get back in queue after that.\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nDo you want to go first, Brian?\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nYes, I can go with cash flow. So cash flow, we're thinking around $20 million to $40 million of free cash flow for next year. But one of the big things that might drive that is really where the demand is. A big portion of our working capital and our investment that goes into inventory. So depending on where demand is in the second half of the year and going into 2024, that can change pretty significantly.\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nAnd in terms of the dealers, I think they're in decent shape in the U.S. They're all pretty well lined up in terms of our build schedules in Europe, especially in the tower cranes, we've definitely seen a slowdown and they're loaded up. I mean the inventory that they would have taken in the fourth quarter, they really haven't started to move. And then I'm speaking specifically in Germany for some of the smaller tower cranes. Right now is the time that was usually -- move quickly as you head into the spring months, but that's been pretty slow at this stage. And that's what's got us nervous about the tower crane business.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.\n\nStephen Edward Volkmann\n\nI'm curious just as we sort of look back at 2022, any interesting share shifts in your view, either geographically or product wise?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nI wouldn't say that there was anything drastic. I mean I think the biggest difficulty right now when looking at market shares is normally based off of shipments. And so many of us have all these supply chain constraints, we also have shipment constraints. So I think it's tough to really dig through the market share numbers and make good sense of them.\n\nStephen Edward Volkmann\n\nOkay. And then just back to kind of the margin. I guess your margin outlook is up about 10 basis points or something, if my math is right. And I guess I might have thought it would be a little higher only because it felt like your backlog sort of the prices you were quoting and the price cost and the backlog as we talked about that in sort of 3Q, I felt like it would be improved going into '23. So is the underlying margin actually up a little bit more and then the mix of towers just sort of brings us back to breakeven?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. It's definitely -- the biggest piece of it is the mix issue. And then there's other challenges out there. I mean right now, I mean we have 2 large facilities in France and everyone in France is striking over the recent bill that Macron is pushing for retirement age. So I mean there's some other underlying issues that we're still battling just like productivity around part shortages.\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nWe're definitely going to see labor inflation in '23.\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes.\n\nStephen Edward Volkmann\n\nOkay. Got it. And then the final one, and I'll pass it on. When you talk about your crane renaissance, Aaron, and you talk about China, you talk about Saudi, et cetera, those sound mostly like tower crane kind of drivers. I don't know if you'd agree or disagree, but is there a bit of a kind of margin mix headwind as we look over the next few years, even with this crane renaissance?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. It will be both. It will be mobile cranes and tower cranes. They're just depending on the specific projects. So I think it's too early to comment on what sort of mix it ends up looking like.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nSeth Robert Weber\n\nWanted to -- just going back to your supply chain comments. Is there any way to quantify how much -- whatever term you want to use, red tag or hospital inventories or anything like that, that you would call out that's kind of sitting around that's mostly done, waiting for a couple of parts that you could push out if the supply chain gets better? Or is it more just...\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nNo, I would say that the fourth quarter was a lot like the fourth quarter of 2021, where we had a lot of parts come in, and a lot of those orphan cranes got shipped in the fourth quarter, more than what we had anticipated originally. So now it's cleared out and the game starts again.\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nYes. The revenue -- so we were guiding to the low end of the revenue, which would have been about $2 billion. So you can -- our revenue beat from the $2 billion is really kind of that excess shipments that we were not expecting.\n\nSeth Robert Weber\n\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the -- as you guys -- I heard the comment around used cranes a little bit. Can you just talk to what you're sort of seeing in the used crane pricing market? And what you think that might look like through 2023 just from a used pricing perspective?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. I mean from our perspective, used prices have been up as folks have struggled to get machines out of the factory. I think it continues to hold.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next, we'll go to Stanley Elliott with Stifel.\n\nStanley Stoker Elliott\n\nCongratulations. Can you talk a little bit more about bauma show. I mean the 15% improvement in orders, is there a way to clarify like how much of that is from some of the new products that you're coming out with some of the parts of the market that maybe you felt like you had some gaps in the portfolio?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes, I don't think it was necessarily reflected at the bauma show. When I look at new products in total for the year, I mean there were some [altering] that got launched earlier in the year, but because they originally -- we expected bauma to be in April. So I wouldn't say that there's much really 2 comments with respect to bauma.\n\nStanley Stoker Elliott\n\nAnd curious on the move on the -- expanding, I guess, the rental fleet into the U.K. market. Can you talk about what sort of investments you would need there? And how you think that, that can ultimately progress?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes. I mean, we like to go by step by step, and we will be focused on supporting the major rental houses. They do RPOs and short-term rentals. So I mean it's within the context of our budget side. Again, I don't think it's anything extraordinary. It would be a handful of cranes and we'll go step by step, just like we did in Germany.\n\nBrian P. Regan\n\nYes. The numbers are in the CapEx forecast that we provided.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll move to our next question, Steven Fisher with UBS.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nJust wanted to, Aaron, you mentioned that China is in a kind of a wait and see mode. I'm curious if you have any bias at this point about how this year plays out, any more kind of recent data points that kind of give you a sense one way or the other of what's really going on there?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nNo. I mean I was just spent a week with the fellow who runs China for us and it's still pretty quiet. I mean I think people are optimistic, but it's still too early to really say how it's going to play out.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nOkay. And then following up on Jerry's question about the Middle East. I'm wondering if you can maybe compare the Middle East opportunity to the European business because it sounds like the European area is kind of one of the main concerns at this point and it might drag on for a little while. But yet on the Middle East, it sounds like it's one of the more quickly to ramp up. Do you think the Middle East business could sort of offset the kind of the weakness that you see in Europe and then kind of net-net North America is kind of the rest of the swing factor?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes, that's the hope. I don't think it fully offsets it, and there are much different cranes and bigger cranes. I mean most of the cranes we will send in the Middle East, they come from a mix of Europe and China factories, but I think the big orders still -- that will be slow to come. I mean it won't come until the fourth quarter. We've seen some orders related to those projects, but not in earnest as they will likely be.\n\nSteven Fisher\n\nAnd how is the competitive environment in the Middle East relative to Europe or other markets?\n\nAaron H. Ravenscroft\n\nYes, it's unusual because it's a real mixed bag depending on machine availability. I mean I've heard pricing sort of all over the map, including the Chinese. So I think it really depends on the availability and how badly someone needs the crane. At this stage, I think that there's plenty of business to go around for everybody. So it's much more managed than it had been the last couple of years. I mean the last couple of years, it was down in dirty fighting over singular cranes where now there's much bigger projects, I think that will help eat up everyone's capacity and keep pricing more reasonable.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Warner for closing remarks.\n\nIon M. Warner\n\nBefore we conclude today's call, please note that a replay of our fourth quarter 2022 conference call will be available later this morning by accessing the Investor Relations section of our website at www.manitowoc.com.

Welcome to the Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n\nTheresa Womble\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to our call this morning. On today's call, Vic Grizzle, our CEO; and Chris Calzaretta, our CFO, will discuss Armstrong World Industries fourth quarter 2022 results, and our outlook for 2023. To accompany these remarks, we have provided a presentation that is available on the IR section of the Armstrong World Industries website.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nThank you, Theresa, and good morning, and thank you all for joining our call today. Today, we reported solid fourth quarter and full year results, and what continues to be a challenging environment for many of our end markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nChristopher P. Calzaretta\n\nThanks, Vic, and good morning to everyone on the call. As I review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, as well as our 2023 outlook, please keep in mind that I'll be referring to the slides available on our website, and Slide 3 details our basis of presentation.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nThanks, Chris. As Chris referenced, we're planning for further economic weakening in 2023 and have taken a thoughtful look at our organization. Our growth investments and all the levers in our control to ensure we deliver consistent profitable growth.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.\n\nSusan Marie Maklari\n\nMy first question is thinking about the pricing in the Mineral Fiber segment, you've obviously seen a lot of success there over the last couple of years actually in this inflationary environment. As you think about 2023, can you talk a bit of the ability to continue to get incremental pricing through? And how much of the gains you're expecting for this year reflect carryover versus potentially moving back to a more normalized cadence of pricing?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. Susan, the backdrop to that clearly is, as Chris mentioned, a continuation of the inflationary environment. We expect a tail on this inflationary curve given -- and a lot of companies are probably in a situation where they are protected under contracts in 2022. And as those contracts roll over, there's some catch-up in some of the inflation or in those contracts in terms of inflation.\n\nSusan Marie Maklari\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. And then thinking a bit about the office end market. Clearly, you talked about some of the weakness that you're seeing there. That's been an area that's been a little slower to come back relative to some of the other sectors that you cover in there.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. I think the -- again, the office segment is about 30% of our business, right? So it's not the majority of our business, but it certainly is impactful in the Mineral Fiber business, as you're referencing.\n\nSusan Marie Maklari\n\nOkay. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.\n\nKeith Brian Hughes\n\nOn the guidance for the year, you've given kind of a framework for it. But is it fair to assume that you're expecting every one of your end-user markets to contract or in volume? Or is there some kind of standout positives? Can you some sort of idea what the flavor of what's going on?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. I think broadly speaking, Keith, we're expecting traction and activity across all of the verticals. I think there's a couple of standouts. Let me just -- I mean, transportation, I mentioned the Pittsburgh Airport project, but there are several other airport projects that we're winning. And I would expect us to outperform in the Transportation segment.\n\nKeith Brian Hughes\n\nAnd there was a comment earlier about the second half of the year, I guess, being weaker. Is that a volume comment? Or I just kind of missed what you were going towards with that?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nThat's a volume -- referencing to market activity and its impact on volumes, Keith. But again, I think as I've been around, Keith in talking to our customers, I think they have visibility in the first half, and they kind of see it as a run rate similar to the fourth quarter run rates.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\n\nGarik Simha Shmois\n\nJust wondering if you could speak to the cadence of project delays as opposed to outright cancelations. I think last quarter, you were seeing delays, you weren't seeing cancellations. I was wondering, if maybe the proportion there has changed a bit over the last 90 days?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. We continue to track this, Garik. I would say that for the most part, these continue to be delays. You'll hear 1 or 2 projects, especially in the tech sector, right? We'll hear some, it would sounds like a cancellation even if it's closed and delayed language, it feels like a cancellation. Again, that's isolated to a couple of projects in the tech sector. But for the most part, most of these projects continue to be in delayed status.\n\nGarik Simha Shmois\n\nI want to follow-up on inventories. You talked about destocking in WAVE. Are you seeing any destocking in any other channels?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nWe saw -- again, it's all in the same channel, right? Just to remind everybody, our grid products that are made by our WAVE joint venture, and our tile products are sold as a package through the same channel. But in the other channels like the home centers, if you will, and the like, we've not seen the same destocking. It's kind of the normal pattern of buildup in inventory and a drawdown in inventory. We've seen that similar behavior, but it's not unique behavior.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.\n\nPhilip H. Ng\n\nVic, I was a little confused on your comments -- I was lot confused on your comments on your outlook on volumes. I thought you were saying 1Q was tracking kind of with fourth quarter -- I mean, sorry, the first half of 2023 is going to be tracking similar to fourth quarter levels, which was down about 10%, I think. But you're also saying maybe the back half could be weaker or you have less visibility. So kind of help us think through the volume progression through the year? I just want to make sure we understand the moving pieces.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. That comparison is really market-to-market comparison. If you look at the minus 10 in the fourth quarter, there's a lot of noise in that, right, with that base period comparison from what we had a January price increase that drove a lot more volume in the fourth quarter last year. So a big part of that 10, as we've been talking about as a base period comparison.\n\nPhilip H. Ng\n\nSo is that like down with mid-single digits? Or I just want to make sure we get the number, right? So they're closer to down mid? Is it down high? I just want to make sure we get the first half right versus the back half.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nWell, I think the way to think about this is for our full year, we're outlooking for the full year down mid-single digits. Our first half is probably not as much as down 5 as we outlook a further slowdown in the back half of the year to get to that average of down mid-single digits.\n\nChristopher P. Calzaretta\n\nAnd maybe just to add on a little bit, Phil. Yes, just for maybe a little more there. On the first quarter, we expect positive volume as we're lapping the prior year period, which was softer, but then the progression of volumes for the rest of the year kind of decelerates Q2 through Q4. And as Vic mentioned, really a more pronounced softness in the back half of the year.\n\nPhilip H. Ng\n\nOkay. That makes perfect sense. And then on price cost, how much do you think is carryover in terms of your 8% AUV guide for 2023? And on the inflation side, appreciating you're seeing some relief on nat gas perhaps. But how should we think about inflation for 2023 and that price cost all go for you guys this year?\n\nChristopher P. Calzaretta\n\nSo Phil, it's Chris. So on the inflation, I'd be thinking about overall input cost inflation around the -- in the mid-single digits range. You mentioned nat gas a little bit of deflationary environment there. But as Vic mentioned earlier, on the raw side, that's really where we're going to see a lot of the continued inflationary pressure with some of those input costs kind of rolling by way of contracts that are picking up here in 2023, and had higher levels of inflation. That's kind of how I'd paint the inflationary landscape for '23, mid-single digits.\n\nPhilip H. Ng\n\nChris, is the pricing you guys are guiding to AUV, is that more skewed towards carryover? Or is it pretty evenly split between incremental price versus carryover?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. I'd be thinking more in terms of that AUV split overall absent the carryover, more weighted towards price in that AUV number.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates.\n\nAdam Michael Baumgarten\n\nJust back on the first half commentary and you talked about activity levels similar to 4Q. So should we sort of be thinking about quarterly earnings in the first couple of quarters of the year, similar to 4Q as well?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nWell, I think -- I'm going to stay away from some of the quarterly specific guidance on that, but I think the volume side of this is a pretty good proxy what we saw, except again for the base period comparison. We're not talking about minus 10 volume.\n\nAdam Michael Baumgarten\n\nOkay. No, that's helpful. And then just on the margin side, just -- I know you mentioned some of the digital initiatives you're shelving and the savings around that. But just broadly speaking, as we think about SG&A, which has been growing over the last couple of years. How should we think about it from a dollar's perspective in '23 and what's embedded in your guidance?\n\nChristopher P. Calzaretta\n\nYes. So -- this is Chris. So in terms of the guide and assumptions around SG&A, I mean, there's continued investments there in 2023 above 2022 to then further invest back in the business. And that's both in AS as well as on the Mineral Fiber side of the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.\n\nRafe Jason Jadrosich\n\nJust following up on the SG&A, the last question on SG&A. Can you just give a little bit more color on the assumption of gross margin versus this year ratio through 2023, and is there any commentary on the cadence of inflation through the year will be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. So let me take the second part of that first, Rafe. So yes, expect certainly on the raw materials side, the front half to be a little more inflationary weighted. And then going back to margins on initiatives, as we talked, we expect some strong margin contribution here in 2023 in our digital initiatives, but haven't really outlooked obviously, the overall gross margin impact.\n\nRafe Jason Jadrosich\n\nThat's helpful. And then just as you think about the SG&A outlook, sort of longer term, you do have some longer-term initiatives that you're investing in, and then obviously more cautious on the near-term. If volume stays under pressure kind of going into 2024, or office stays sort of weak. Would you look at pulling back on some of those SG&A investments? Just how do you think about the level of investment going kind of over the long-term relative to the market condition?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. Let me take that. I think, Rafe, the way we would think about this is kind of how we thought about it coming into this year. If the market opportunity environment is challenging, then we'll be looking at the rate and pace of our investments.\n\nRafe Jason Jadrosich\n\nVery clear.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.\n\nJoseph David Ahlersmeyer\n\nYes. I don't know that you guys having to explain the volume comps, and I heard that pretty loud and clear that I think you said was going to say on that.\n\nChristopher P. Calzaretta\n\nYes. I think -- Joe, it's Chris. I think you're thinking about that the right way. I'll stop short of quantifying it, but that's certainly included in the overall, call it, SG&A step-up, coupled with an inflationary assumption there on wages, et cetera, that goes into that step-up for SG&A.\n\nJoseph David Ahlersmeyer\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And when I look at your contributing factors to the EBITDA bridge, you have volume and manufacturing, the volume number seems to imply in sort of the quarters where you have down volumes that under absorption is included in that number?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. That's right. So going back kind of to the bridge, any productivity you'd see in that manufacturing line in that table, that's the right way to think about it. That's where it would fall out.\n\nJoseph David Ahlersmeyer\n\nIs there a number on the manufacturing that you're targeting for '23?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes, there is. And we spend public around what that productivity number is, and it's about 3% of adjusted COGS and that's kind of how we've historically been targeting and delivering against manufacturing productivity Mineral Fiber side.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Lovallo with UBS.\n\nJohn Lovallo\n\nThe first one was you mentioned -- you mentioned the strong growth in 2022 for Healthy Spaces and then also talked about the CARES Act and the education funding in there. I mean, do you see education as a real opportunity in 2023 for Healthy Spaces?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. I think education was actually a strong point for us in '22, obviously, got overshadowed by a lot of other dynamics. But yes, I think based on what we're seeing in the bidding activity, and the money being spent there, again, to improve air quality, in particular, in schools. And with our product portfolio, I think it's an opportunity. Again, there's no question about it.\n\nJohn Lovallo\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then in terms of Architectural Specialties and maybe some of the slowing that we're just seeing and just broadly in the economy. I mean, are you seeing any opportunities on the acquisition front present themselves given the slowing?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nI wouldn't tie it just a slowing activity. I think we've been proactive with a lot of these companies that are not for sale. So I wouldn't say there's a step change in interest level based on a slowing economy, I wouldn't attribute at least the advancement of our pipeline to that specifically.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.\n\nStephen Kim\n\nLot of and good info already provided. A couple of quick ones for me. In Mineral Fiber, you talked a little bit about positive mix. I was curious, if you could be a little more specific about what you're seeing there?\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. Let me grab the second one first on AUV because in our AUV numbers, we don't include Architectural Specialties. So that's really a Mineral Fiber number. Given the project nature and the cost of nature of Architectural Specialties, we choose not to pollute that metric. So anything you're seeing in AUV is really Mineral Fiber, is all Mineral Fiber driven, okay?\n\nStephen Kim\n\nYes. I mean -- yes, historically, I know that certainly AUV is limited to Mineral Fiber in your comments suggest that's going to continue. It's just I think in your presentation, it looked like 29 and for the whole company, and it was 30 for Mineral Fiber. But that's fine. I'm sure it's probably just rounding or something.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. Again, I'll stay away from the quarterly guidance on WAVE. It's a big part of our -- in terms of our equity earnings, right, to our EBITDA level. But again, WAVE had the same kind of destocking in the first half of the year last year as we did on the tile side. So sold through the same channel again under the same pressures.\n\nStephen Kim\n\nYes, sure. That's great. Last one for me is in Architectural Specialties. Kind of a 2-part of there, but curious if you could -- that division is getting pretty large now. And I'm just curious if you could sort of call out any specific product categories within Architectural Specialties that we might want to be keeping our eye on, where maybe the trends are a little stronger than even the segment as a whole.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. That's a good question. Probably the highlight of what's going on in Architectural Specialties is the broad nature of the demand and the growth. It's not in 1 vertical or 1 product category, it's really across the board. And it's very encouraging that we're broadly playing in these new spaces in commercial buildings. And that's a really encouraging sign.\n\nChristopher P. Calzaretta\n\nAnd maybe just to close out there, Stephen. So the grid sales you should be thinking about going through the WAVE equity earnings line.\n\nStephen Kim\n\nAll right. That's helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.\n\nKathryn Ingram Thompson\n\nJust as obviously, lots of detail on volume and outlook today, but just a higher-level approach in terms of forecasting, the landscape has clearly changed a lot in a post-COVID world, and all the various factors impacting today.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes, I think we've -- it's a fair question, Kathryn, on our forecasting. And given our inability to forecast it well last year, I think there was some just extraordinary set of dynamics that confused, I think a lot of the information -- the traditional information that we would use for forecasting. So maybe the biggest change, I think, for us, as we think about forecasting is the sources of where we get our information and different levels of information.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Vic Grizzle for any closing remarks.\n\nVictor D. Grizzle\n\nYes. Thank you, again, all for joining and for the questions. We worked hard to clarify and provide as much color as we could today given the uncertainty that's in the marketplace today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Inc., Research Division\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome ladies and gentlemen to the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call for Tactile Medical (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website for replay shortly.\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nThank you, operator and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. I'm joined on line by our Chief Financial Officer, Brent Moen. I'll start off today's remarks with a high level overview of our financial performance in the fourth quarter, and the factors that drove our better than expected performance. Then I'll share an update on some of the important operational highlights during the quarter and in recent months. Brent will review our financial results in greater detail, along with financial guidance for 2023, which we introduced in our earnings press release today. And then I'll conclude by sharing some additional thoughts on our strategic priorities for 2023 and our outlook for this year and the years to come before we begin the Q&A session.\n\nBrent A. Moen\n\nThanks, Dan. It has been a privilege to serve as a member of Tactile's executive leadership team and work with an excellent group of colleagues to develop and grow the organization as we bring life changing therapies to patients. Given the strength and the depth of our team, and the financial and operational progress made over the course of the last year, I believe this is the right time for me to begin my transition to retiring from CFO role at Tactile. I'd like to thank everyone on our team for their support over the last 5 years and I look forward to supporting a smooth transition.\n\nStory continues\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nThanks, Brent. Our 2023 guidance reflects our belief in the ability to return to double-digit organic revenue growth on an annual basis while driving year-over-year improvements in our profitability profile. This view is based in part on the financial and operational progress we made in 2022 with an increasingly established lymphedema field sales team, traction emerging within our DME channel partners and the momentum created by our new product introductions. We believe we're well positioned as we enter 2023 to drive strong, sustainable, profitable growth going forward.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.\n\nAdam Carl Maeder\n\nDan and Brent, congrats on the quarter and a nice finish to the year, and Brent, congrats on the upcoming retirement. Maybe just to start, I wanted to ask for a little bit more color on the 2023 outlook as it relates to the top line, the 9% to 11%. I think I heard lymphedema growth of 8% to 9%, airway clearance of 18% to 22%. Maybe just talk a little bit about kind of what's assumed from a procedure environment standpoint? AffloVest, are there supply chain headwinds that are lingering into '23? How do we think about those? Any revenue contribution from new product launches? And then just, I guess, is there some general conservatism baked into the guide as we look to kind of square your outlook versus where you exited the year? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nThanks for the question, Adam. Yes, let me give you a little bit of color on how we arrived at '23 guidance. And if Brent has anything he wants to add, I'll turn it over to him. First of all, I think it's worth pointing out that we're really trying to demonstrate balanced growth here, both in revenue and operating margin. And getting back to double-digits is a step in the direction that we wanted to make. The lymphedema growth assumes a growth of -- for the full-year, doubling what we did in 2022. So we're certainly moving in the direction that we want to go and getting back to double-digit roughly overall. It also reflects cautious and I think leverage in the profitability side, demonstrating over 30% of adjusted EBITDA growth in the guidance as well.\n\nAdam Carl Maeder\n\nThat's really helpful, Dan. I appreciate the color there. And then I guess I'll just ask one kind of housekeeping question and then a follow-up. But on housekeeping, AffloVest, did you see any impact to your Q4 result there from supply chain? It was another nice quarter, but revenue did step down sequentially. So just wondering if you can quantify any potential impact from supply chain. And then for the follow-up, just help us kind of think through the commercial organization on the lymphedema side. I think you said you exited with 250 heads. Is that the right number for this business going forward? And maybe just kind of talk about the levers there to drive increased productivity in '23?\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nSure. So on the AffloVest, yes, we did have a bit of supply chain constraints that still lingered into Q4. I think Brent even mentioned some of the spot buy impacts on gross margin. But again, I think that we expect that we've kind of managed our way through those. So I think that we expect less of a headwind related to those in 2023. It's always going to be a little bit naturally lumpier than our direct lymphedema business. But with a 90% growth that we still saw in Q4, I think a solid result overall.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Margarate Boeye with William Blair.\n\nMargarate Elizabeth Boeye\n\nI wanted to maybe go a little further just like Adam did in terms of sales guidance for lymphedema. And just to know what we're assuming -- what you're assuming basically in rep productivity versus what we saw in the fourth quarter. And then also touching maybe a little bit on your comments of the VA reopening being able to see those patients again. Can that help drive results in '23? And then since you mentioned the potential kind of macro impact, are you seeing any of that at this point or that was just what was contemplated in guidance?\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nLet me take a shot at those. I think from a Q4 rep productivity, we were really pleased with the productivity we saw on a per rep headcount. It's always worth reminding that Q4 is just a different dynamic with co-pays having mostly been addressed earlier in the year on kind of a broad basis, we always see a step up. So it's always kind of our best quarter from a productivity standpoint. We're hopeful that we can continue to demonstrate expanded productivity in 2023. But that's one of the reasons that we always see a bit of an expansion there. From the VA question, we did see some anecdotal return to some of the VA centers. But I think it's a little early to declare victory there. They seem to behave in an inconsistent manner such that the old adage, if you've seen one VA, you've seen one VA. We haven't heard about a broad return to the VA centers. But certainly, on an anecdotal basis, it was helpful.\n\nMargarate Elizabeth Boeye\n\nAnd then I wanted to walk through the adjusted EBITDA improvement expected this year, impressive in terms of operating expenses only going up. I think I heard low single digits versus kind of the guidance on the top line. So I guess, what would get you to the high and low end of the range? How hard are you kind of pushing the operating levers? And then how should we think about free cash flow change for the year as well?\n\nBrent A. Moen\n\nHey Margarate, it's Brent. Good questions. So as we look at kind of the operating expense profile, certainly, and I think Dan's probably mentioned, if not on this call, previous calls. But certainly, our focus is on the cost to serve. So how much -- how expensive is to serve a patient and how do we actually bring that cost down. And so we've got dedicated focus in 2023 to delivering profitable growth. So one of the things Dan mentioned in his previous answer to Adam was certainly about headcount. And to the extent we can reduce or at least normalize the turnover in our sales force, that certainly provides both productivity and upside in terms of leverage there.\n\nMargarate Elizabeth Boeye\n\nAnd then the free cash flow?\n\nBrent A. Moen\n\nOh, free cash flow. Yes, right. So we finished the year at $22 million of cash to sort of $22 million. As we look into 2023, we'll generate a pretty significant amount of cash flow, but we've got some commitments in '23 that we've got to focus on. They particularly include the remainder of the earn-out to AffloVest. So we've got a $15 million commitment provided that AffloVest continues to drive an increase in revenue. We've got some CapEx obligations, albeit minor to the tune of about $2 million. We've got debt service that we've got out there. All of those things are commitments that we have. But one thing to keep in mind, Margarate, is that if we -- even at the midpoint, if we generate $24 million of adjusted EBITDA, we certainly believe that we've got enough cash to continue to support the growth of this organization and make the necessary investments for the future as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\n\nRyan Benjamin Zimmerman\n\nCongrats on a good end of the year, and Brent, congrats on the retirement. I don't know if this is like a Tom Brady type retirement you might come back in the year, but we do appreciate working with you over the years to this company and others. I want to ask about the long-term guidance that you're putting out there, Dan, if I do the math, it looks like about a 12%, 13% CAGR over the next few years. Just help us understand kind of the cadence of your expectations. How to think about that CAGR and kind of as we get out to 2025 and so forth?\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nYes. I think, first of all, the reason that we put out -- let me take a step back, the reason we put out the 2025 numbers was, I think as we've emerged from the post-COVID environment, there's been an interest in what does the future look like. And while we wanted to clearly give '23 guidance today, I think the question continues to be kind of what's on the other side of the horizon. That's why we established those 25 numbers. We're -- we'll give -- as we did today, 2023 guidance, we're not going to break out 2024 and 2025 at this point. And if we found ourselves there a bit early, we'd be delighted. But I think the point we were trying to make was from an investor standpoint, we think that there's consistent double-digit growth in front of us we think the opportunity to establish an expanded adjusted EBITDA profile to the tune of $50 million by 2025. And then the free cash flow piece, I think is an important one that we try to establish as well.\n\nRyan Benjamin Zimmerman\n\nAnd then, Dan, you kind of hinted at the pipeline getting more robust and just a steady stream of updates. Maybe I don't want to steal the thunder here, but can you expand a little bit on kind of what you're thinking and where you go over the next few years from a new product standpoint?\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nSure. Yes, new product development continues to be an important one for us. We want to make sure that we continue to demonstrate ourselves as a leader and making sure that the patient experience increasingly becomes more consumer-like as part of that journey. I can certainly add specifically in 2023 in the first half, we're going to introduce just a line extension on AffloVest. We have a size gap on some of the larger patients that we couldn't accommodate and we'll be introducing that in the first half. We're also going to refresh our Entre device in the first half of the year with some feature enhancements.\n\nRyan Benjamin Zimmerman\n\nAppreciate all the color, and congrats again (inaudible)year.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer & Company.\n\nSuraj Kalia\n\nFirst and foremost, let me echo the sentiments Brent. It's been a pleasure working with you through the years and wish you all the success in your next endeavor. So Dan, a few questions, at least from my side, maybe Brent can also jump in. Dan, when we look at the number of tenure (inaudible) how many would you say are \"tenured\" how many would you say currently have, let's say, $1 million, $1.5 million annual productivity, which is usually sort of what the target you'll have talked to in the past?\n\nBrent A. Moen\n\nSuraj, it's Brent. I'll take a shot and then Dan can chime in. But I think as we exited 2021, we saw larger than normal turnover in our sales rep category. And I think that led to some of the things we communicated back in the back half of 2021. Throughout 2022, we've seen good success in being able to get our sales force back to where we believe we can sustain growth in 2023. So in terms of the turnover, our turnover on an average basis, we expect it to be in roughly 20% range, and it was outsized in '21. So you can imagine that the ability to become productive certainly started to show itself in the latter half of 2022 and will continue to provide benefit into 2023. But we're going to talk a little -- talk much about the number of reps that are at that point.\n\nSuraj Kalia\n\nFair enough. And last couple of questions. I'll ask both of them. One for you, Brent, one for Dan, and I'll hop back in the queue. So Brent, first, in terms of the FY '23 guide, forgive me if I missed it. I know you all gave the overall lymphedema growth, but I'm more interested in the Commercial component of it if you could give some additional color there. Also, what was the impact of ASPs with ComfortEase and others to the guide? And then specifically for you, in terms of Kylee, maybe I'm just looking at it from a purely engineering perspective, right? It's a great step-up in terms of data gathering. And presumably, it's passive in nature. Could it become more assistive in the future, i.e., improving compliance and functionality? Brent, congrats again.\n\nBrent A. Moen\n\nThanks, Suraj. I appreciate that. So I'll provide a little bit of color on Commercial. I think your first question was what we should expect from Commercial? And I'll just be honest with you, Suraj, we don't forecast by payer in terms of expectations over the course of the year. Our focus is identifying patients and making sure that we can provide the therapies necessary to those patients. And whether it's a Commercial patient or a Medicare patient or a VA patient, all of them are -- we look at equally. So we don't provide much color relative to where the Commercial expectation is relative to that.\n\nDaniel L. Reuvers\n\nI think just to add to that, Suraj, we did have a particularly good quarter as it relates to the Medicare mix in Q4, which you, I suspect, recognized. And I think that it's less about focusing on a payer and more about a prescriber source. So the vascular call point has continued to be an important one to us. The fact that we have bilateral solutions, including trunk, which serves the entire need of those patients. And I think that ComfortEast has started to open the eyes of some prescribers perhaps they may have considered or been dismissive of an older patient just thinking it was going to be too difficult. And the addition of zippers and making it easier to apply perhaps has, I think, gotten some prescribers to consider patients they may have otherwise overlooked. I think the other one was this elimination of the CMN gave us an opportunity to go in and revisit with prescribers on process. And any time we have a chance to engage with them, it's typically a good opportunity. And I think that those both were a bit reflective in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are currently seeing no remaining questions at this time. That does conclude our conference today.

Thank you for joining Sohu's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host for today's conference call, Huang Pu, Investor Relations Director of Sohu. Please go ahead.\n\nPu Huang\n\nThanks, operator. Thank you for joining us to discuss Sohu's fourth quarter 2022 results. On the call are Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Charles Zhang; CFO, Joanna Lv; and Vice President of Finance, James Deng. Also with us are Changyou's CEO Dewen Chen; and CFO Yaobin Wang.\n\nChaoyang Zhang\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining our call. In the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, we continue to refine our products and optimize operating efficiency with strict budget control, despite the negative impact of COVID-19 and the macroeconomic challenges, thanks to our efforts, brand advertising revenue and bottom line performance both exceeded our prior guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nYanfeng Lv\n\nThank you, Charles. I will now walk you through the key financials of our major segments for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. All the numbers on a non-GAAP basis -- you may find a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures on our IR website. For Sohu Media Portal, quarterly revenues were $16 million, down 16% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. The quarterly operating loss was $32 million compared with an operating loss of $38 million in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2022, Sohu Media Portal revenues were $61 million, down 19% compared with 2021. The full year operating loss was $156 million compared with an operating loss of $134 million in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from Jefferies.\n\nThomas Chong\n\nMy first question is about the overall advertising industry outlook in 2023. Can management comment about the sentiment so far? And on Sohu, how should -- we should think about the advertising spending among [auto] FMCG, Internet services? And my second question is more about the use of cash and our investment strategies for this year. And finally, may I also get some color for management about our thoughts on the recent (inaudible) and how we shape the Internet sector?\n\nChaoyang Zhang\n\nOkay. So the first overall advertising market after the -- basically, the lift of the lockup and after the COVID-19, I think the economy is picking up in the first quarter. So we are seeing an outlook of -- kind of optimistic about the overall advertising market compared with the last year 2022 because companies are starting to spend -- start marketing events -- spending money to market their products and brand building. In terms of the industry, I think auto is the first one, right? Auto -- followed by FMCG, right? Interim service in Q4 of '21, Yes. Actually, for both part of Q4, we're still in the lockdown era, right? So -- but because of our some live broadcasting activities, we were -- we have growth, right, improving advertising up, right? Improvement of 12% in Q4. But that was still during the lockup years. And -- so 2023, we're kind of optimistic. We see the economy is picking up and the company is starting to spend money now. And the investment strategy, I think first of all, we will have -- we will continue to invest in the products, refining our products and building the -- and also the Sohu networks and also to spend on user acquisition with a -- with the products ready and with its features with improving stickiness. We're going to spend money, use the acquisition. As we did in 2022 online video -- on video -- Sohu Video, spending more than before on Sohu Video. That's why you see the loss of video business widening, right, in last year. So this year, we'll spend both on video on the Sohu new -- Sohu Media Portal. It separates Sohu News App. When we believe that our product is ready and with stickiness and to acquire users and make sure they come and they stay. In terms of more investment, probably with AI technology and ChatGPT and we'll -- actually, our new premium -- our new recommendation algorithms is a deep application of AI technology like deep learning and all these algorithms or AI. (inaudible) have the whole ChatGPT type of openAI services. It's -- since we already -- Sogou, we already sold Sogou so this need to have the whole -- develop the whole algorithm from bottom up is really need the kind of company with a search engine background. Now we already sold Sogou. Right now, we are not able to develop the whole openAI system, but we can outsource the fundamental layers of those algorithms and to some other companies and then to just use the applications apply them to our for our social network because it's about questioning and answering and interactivity. So it fits well with our social network strategy. Well, I hope I answered your question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nEddie Leung\n\nJust two questions. The first one is about games. Just wondering if that one has any, I won't say guidance, but any outlook on the potential launch time of some of the new games. And then secondly, I think Charles you talked a little bit about that. So in terms of use of cash because you guys still have a very good cash balance. In addition to investment, will there be any potential plan for, for example, more share buyback or even dividend?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\n[Interpreted] Currently, we plan to launch new TLBB in third quarter this year.\n\nChaoyang Zhang\n\nSo we -- we will not exclude the possibility of share buybacks this year. Yes, it's possible. We may.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citi.\n\nAlicia Yap\n\nCan you hear me? I have a couple of questions. First, on a follow-up on the gaming business. So the driver for your sequential improvement for your gaming business that you've guided for first quarter, is that mainly on some of the expansion packs that has released and been doing well. So that's you guided slight improvement on the gaming for 1Q. That's the first question within the gaming. And then a follow up on the new TLBB launch because we also know there is another similar title, which is called TLBB 2 by Perfect War. So would that be -- can you comment? Would there be any confusions or any cannibalization effect from this similar title? And then for advertising business, can you also elaborate a little bit in terms of the first quarter guidance? Do you think this is actually considering an improving trend? Because it does look like your guidance on a year-over-year basis, is still a negative growth despite the entire year already having declined. And -- but is it because of the Chinese New Year in first quarter? So would you expect second quarter of where we should start to get positive year-over-year growth?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\n[Interpreted] Because we launched some promotional activities for our existing games in the first quarter around Chinese New Year.\n\nChaoyang Zhang\n\nAll right. In terms of advertising, so the first quarter of 2022 is basically before it's prior -- it's before the real lockdown that happened in Q2, right? So it's relatively a more normal quarter, right, Q1. But this quarter, the Q1 of 2023 is -- as Q4, we already pick up some time pick up some, but it's due to some of our potential unique offering of this (inaudible). But Q1, first of all, it's a slow season, but it's also a -- it's still restoring, right? It's resuming, but still not fully to its prior guidance -- prior locked quarter, right? That's why it's kind of decrease. I answer your question?\n\nAlicia Yap\n\nYes, I see what you mean. In terms of the year-over-year.\n\nChaoyang Zhang\n\nQ2 is to pick up speed, yes. I'm sure Q2 will definitely be better. Q2 in 2022. I think Q2 and Q3 of 2022 were worst, right, because the lockdown is in the lockdown, in Shanghai and then -- so this Q1 is we already see some hope, right? So it's picking up, but it's still not fully resumed or...\n\nAlicia Yap\n\nI just have one very quick follow-up. In terms of the Sohu Media and Sohu Video, do we have any plan or target to narrow the loss this year?\n\nChaoyang Zhang\n\nActually, the answer is no because we're going to spend, as you ask -- you were asking the question about how do I spend -- we have a cash -- good cash balance, right? So that's why we need a war chest to really develop in order to have ultimately have the profitable platform, we have to have a larger user base. You have to have the scale, scale of the user base. And that's the only way for a platform to make money, right? So -- but to reach that, you need to spend. That's why we're into this year, as I said, when we have -- when we believe that the kind of products that we are designing or we have been perfecting or developing are ready. Have the right kind of stickiness and so to make the user stay then where we spend. As we did in -- on Video, kind of spending a little more on Video in 2022, so -- and we see the user base actually grow quite well. But -- so we're going to spend both on Video and News App.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) All right. I am showing no further questions. And with that, we conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We define CASM ex-fuel as total operating expenses by available seat mile, excluding fuel expense. We define Adjusted CASM ex fuel as total operating expenses by available seat mile, excluding fuel expense, aircraft and engine variable lease expenses and sale and lease back gains. We define EBITDAR as earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, depreciation of right of use assets and aircraft and engine variable lease expenses. We define Net debt-to-LTM EBITDAR as Net debt divided by LTM EBITDAR.\n\nThese non-IFRS measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial information presented in this release that is calculated and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), because we believe that they, in conjunction with the IFRS financial information, provide useful information to management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of our operating performance.\n\nBecause non-IFRS measures are not calculated in accordance with IFRS, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related IFRS measures presented in this release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in the method of calculation and in the items being adjusted.\n\nWe encourage investors to review our financial statements and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in their entirety for additional information regarding the Company and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\nControladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V. and Subsidiaries\n\nFinancial and Operating Indicators* (All metrics are compared to 2021 unless otherwise

      "title": "Black Stone Minerals, L.P. Announces Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results; Provides Guidance for 2023",
      "content": "HOUSTON, February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Black Stone Minerals, L.P. (NYSE: BSM) (\"Black Stone Minerals,\" \"Black Stone,\" or \"the Company\") today announces its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and provides guidance for 2023.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Highlights\n\nMineral and royalty production for the fourth quarter of 2022 equaled 40.0 MBoe/d, an increase of 7% over the prior quarter and the highest mineral and royalty production ever reported by the Company; total production, including working interest volumes, was 42.1 MBoe/d for the quarter Net income for the quarter was $183.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled a record $131.7 million Distributable cash flow was $125.3 million for the fourth quarter, which represents an 8% increase relative to the third quarter of 2022, and also a record amount for Black Stone as a public company Announced a distribution of $0.475 per unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2022, which represents a 6% increase from the distribution paid with respect to the third quarter of 2022. Distribution coverage for all units was 1.26x Our quarterly results represent new high-water marks in mineral and royalty production, net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable cash flow and distributions since going public Total debt at the end of the quarter was $10 million; total debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA was 0.02x at year-end\n\nFull Year Financial and Operational Highlights\n\nMineral and royalty volumes in 2022 increased 4% over the prior year to average 34.3 MBoe/d; full year 2022 production was 37.1 MBoe/d Reported 2022 net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $476.5 million and $466.4 million, respectively Increased cash distributions by 85% from $0.945 per unit attributable to the full year 2021 to $1.745 per unit attributable to the full year 2022 Reduced total outstanding debt by $79 million during 2022\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nThomas L. Carter, Jr., Black Stone Minerals’ Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, commented, \"Our record fourth quarter results capped a very successful year for Black Stone Minerals. Without issuing additional equity, we reduced our total debt and increased royalty production through our organic growth efforts to attract additional operator capital to our existing acreage positions. The development programs on our Haynesville and Bossier Shelby Trough acreage continues to ramp up with Aethon as our operating partner. In addition, new drilling activity is continuing to increase across numerous operators on our East Texas Austin Chalk acreage. We enter 2023 well positioned to drive further royalty production growth while maintaining our very healthy balance sheet.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nQuarterly Financial and Operating Results\n\nProduction\n\nBlack Stone Minerals reported mineral and royalty volumes of 40.0 MBoe/d (74% natural gas) for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 37.3 MBoe/d for the third quarter of 2022. Mineral and royalty production was 35.2 MBoe/d for the fourth quarter of 2021. Mineral and royalty production in the fourth quarter of 2022 benefited from a large number of initial payments received on wells in the Midland and Delaware basins, as well as a one-time adjustment to reflect the impact of higher overrides on farmed-out Shelby Trough wells that had achieved payout.\n\nWorking interest production for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 2.1 MBoe/d, and represents a decrease of 19% from the 2.6 MBoe/d for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and a decrease of 46% from the 3.9 MBoe/d for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The continued decline in working interest production is consistent with the Company's decision to farm out its working-interest participation to third-party capital providers.\n\nTotal reported production averaged 42.1 MBoe/d (95% mineral and royalty, 74% natural gas) for the fourth quarter of 2022. Total production was 40.0 MBoe/d and 39.1 MBoe/d for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nRealized Prices, Revenues, and Net Income\n\nThe Company’s average realized price per Boe, excluding the effect of derivative settlements, was $50.67 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. This is a decrease of 15% from $59.30 per Boe for the third quarter of 2022 and a 15% increase compared to $44.12 for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nBlack Stone reported oil and gas revenue of $196.2 million (44% oil and condensate) for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 10% from $218.0 million in the third quarter of 2022. Oil and gas revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $158.9 million.\n\nThe Company reported a gain on commodity derivative instruments of $31.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, composed of a $40.6 million loss from realized settlements and a non-cash $72.0 million unrealized gain due to the change in value of Black Stone’s derivative positions during the quarter. Black Stone reported a loss on commodity derivative instruments of $4.7 million and a gain of $18.4 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nLease bonus and other income was $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily related to leasing activity in Austin Chalk, the Bakken Three Forks and Haynesville plays. Lease bonus and other income for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $3.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\n\nThere was no impairment for the quarters ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Company reported net income of $183.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of $168.5 million in the preceding quarter. For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, net income was $134.2 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $131.7 million, which compares to $123.1 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $77.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Distributable cash flow for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $125.3 million. For the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Distributable cash flow was $116.5 million and $71.3 million, respectively. The reported Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow are both record levels for Black Stone as a public company.\n\n2022 Proved Reserves\n\nEstimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at year-end 2022 were 64.1 MMBoe, an increase of 7% from 59.8 MMBoe at year-end 2021, and were approximately 70% natural gas and 91% proved developed producing. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $1,665.0 million at the end of 2022, as compared to $972.1 million at year-end 2021.\n\nNetherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc., an independent, third-party petroleum engineering firm, evaluated Black Stone Minerals’ estimate of its proved reserves and PV-10 at December 31, 2022. These estimates were prepared using reference prices of $94.14 per barrel of oil and $6.36 per MMBTU of natural gas in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (as compared to prompt month prices of $77.10 per barrel of oil and $2.275 per MMBTU of natural gas as of February 17, 2023). These prices were adjusted for quality and market differentials, transportation fees, and, in the case of natural gas, the value of natural gas liquids. A reconciliation of proved reserves is presented in the summary financial tables following this press release.\n\nFinancialPosition and Activities\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Black Stone Minerals had $4.3 million in cash and $10.0 million outstanding under its credit facility. The Company paid down $50 million of debt during the fourth quarter of 2022 and $79 million of debt during the full year. The ratio of total debt at year-end to 2022 Adjusted EBITDA was 0.02x. The Company’s borrowing base at December 31, 2022 was $550 million, and total commitments under the credit facility were $375 million. The Company's next regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination is set for April 2023. Black Stone is in compliance with all financial covenants associated with its credit facility.\n\nAs of February 17, 2023, no debt was outstanding under the credit facility and the Company had $57.3 million in cash.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company made no repurchases of units under the Board-approved $75 million unit repurchase program.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Distributions\n\nAs previously announced, the Board approved a cash distribution of $0.475 for each common unit attributable to the fourth quarter of 2022. The quarterly distribution coverage ratio attributable to the fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately 1.26x. These distributions will be paid on February 23, 2023 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 16, 2023.\n\nActivity Update\n\nRig Activity\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Black Stone had 108 rigs operating across its acreage position, a 17% increase to rig activity on the Company's acreage as of September 30, 2022 and 14% higher as compared to the 95 rigs operating on the Company's acreage as of December 31, 2021 driven by increased rig activity in the Midland and Delaware basins.\n\nShelby Trough Development Update\n\nIn Angelina County, Texas, ten wells are currently producing under Black Stone’s development agreement with Aethon, and another ten wells are being drilled or completed. Under a separate development agreement with Aethon in San Augustine Texas, four wells are currently producing and another six wells are either drilling or awaiting completion operations.\n\nAustin Chalk Update\n\nThe Company owns a large mineral position in the Brookeland Austin Chalk play in East Texas. To date, eighteen new generation, multi-stage completion wells have turned to sales across the Polk, Jasper, Newton area. Production results have proven that new completion technology can improve well performance in play. Black Stone expects additional drilling by multiple operators over this area in the future.\n\nSummary 2023 Guidance\n\nFollowing are the key assumptions in Black Stone Minerals’ 2023 guidance, as well as comparable results for 2022:\n\nFY 2022 Actual FY 2023 Est. Mineral and royalty production (MBoe/d) 34.3 35 - 37 Working interest production (MBoe/d) 2.8 2 - 3 Total production (MBoe/d) 37.1 37 - 39 Percentage natural gas 74% 72% Percentage royalty interest 92% 94% Lease bonus and other income ($MM) $13.1 $10 - $12 Lease operating expense ($MM) $12.4 $12 - $13 Production costs and ad valorem taxes (as % of total pre-derivative O&G revenue) 9% 9% - 11% G&A - cash ($MM) $36.3 $42 - $44 G&A - non-cash ($MM) $17.4 $12 - $14 G&A - TOTAL ($MM) $53.7 $54 - $58 DD&A ($/Boe) $3.53 $3.50 - $3.75\n\nBlack Stone expects royalty production to increase by approximately 5% in 2023 relative to full year 2022 levels, primarily due to increasing development pace in the Shelby Trough by Aethon in the area and continued development in the Austin Chalk.\n\nWorking interest production is expected to decline in 2023 as a result of Black Stone's decision in 2017 to farm-out participation in its working interest opportunities.\n\nThe Partnership expects general and administrative expenses to be slightly higher in 2023 as a result of inflationary costs and selective hires made to support Black Stone’s ability to evaluate, market and manage its undeveloped acreage positions to potential operators.\n\nHedge Position\n\nBlack Stone has commodity derivative contracts in place covering portions of its anticipated production for 2023 and 2024, including derivative contracts put in place after the end of the year. The Company's hedge position as of February 17, 2023, is summarized in the following tables:\n\nOil Swap Contracts Volume MBbl $/Bbl 4Q22 220,000 $66.47 1Q23 630,000 $79.44 2Q23 540,000 $80.80 3Q23 540,000 $80.80 4Q23 540,000 $80.80 Natural Gas Swap Contracts Volume MMcf $/Mcf 1Q23 9,000,000 $5.07 2Q23 8,190,000 $5.15 3Q23 8,280,000 $5.15 4Q23 8,280,000 $5.15 1Q24 3,640,000 $3.67 2Q24 3,640,000 $3.67 3Q24 3,680,000 $3.67 4Q24 3,680,000 $3.67\n\nMore detailed information about the Company's existing hedging program can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed on or around February 22, 2023.\n\nConference Call\n\nBlack Stone Minerals will host a conference call and webcast for investors and analysts to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 on Wednesday, February 22, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time.

As a result, the Company is unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on its acreage. Accordingly, no NGL volumes are included in our reported production; however, revenue attributable to NGLs is included in natural gas revenue and the calculation of realized prices for natural gas.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by Black Stone's management and external users of the Company's financial statements such as investors, research analysts, and others, to assess the financial performance of its assets and its ability to sustain distributions over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization adjusted for impairment of oil and natural gas properties, if any, accretion of asset retirement obligations, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, non-cash equity-based compensation, and gains and losses on sales of assets, if any. Black Stone defines Distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus amounts for certain non-cash operating activities, cash interest expense, and restructuring charges, if any.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States as measures of the Company's financial performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. The Company's computation of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Net income (loss) $ 183,219 $ 134,194 $ 476,480 $ 181,987 Adjustments to reconcile to Adjusted EBITDA: Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 12,786 14,666 47,804 61,019 Interest expense 2,022 1,441 6,286 5,638 Income tax expense (benefit) (171 ) (4 ) 58 (135 ) Accretion of asset retirement obligations 245 210 861 1,073 Equity-based compensation 5,579 2,513 17,388 12,218 Unrealized (gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments (72,014 ) (75,387 ) (82,486 ) 33,528 (Gain) loss on sale of assets, net — — (17 ) (2,850 ) Adjusted EBITDA 131,666 77,633 466,374 292,478 Adjustments to reconcile to Distributable cash flow: Change in deferred revenue (7 ) (2 ) (30 ) (18 ) Cash interest expense (1,059 ) (1,094 ) (4,282 ) (4,059 ) Preferred unit distributions (5,250 ) (5,250 ) (21,000 ) (21,000 ) Distributable cash flow $ 125,350 $ 71,287 $ 441,062 $ 267,401 Total units outstanding1 209,684 209,118 Distributable cash flow per unit 0.598 0.341\n\n1 The distribution attributable to the quarter ended December 31, 2022 is calculated using 209,683,640 common units as of the record date of February 16, 2023.

      "content": "CVR Partners, LP\n\nAchieved a combined ammonia utilization rate of 96 percent during the fourth quarter of 2022.  Declared a fourth quarter 2022 cash distribution of $10.50 per common unit, bringing the cumulative cash distributions declared for 2022 to $24.58 per common unit. Received upfront proceeds of $18 million in connection with transactions finalized in January 2023 relating to Section 45Q tax credits.\n\nSUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb. 21, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CVR Partners, LP (“CVR Partners” or the “Partnership”) (NYSE: UAN), a manufacturer of ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (“UAN”) solution fertilizer products, today announced net income of $95 million, or $9.02 per common unit, on net sales of $212 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to net income of $61 million, or $5.76 per common unit, on net sales of $189 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. EBITDA was $122 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to EBITDA of $93 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nCVR Partners had net income of $287 million, or $27.07 per common unit, on net sales of $836 million for full-year 2022, compared to net income of $78 million, or $7.31 per common unit, on net sales of $533 million for full-year 2021. EBITDA for full-year 2022 was $403 million, compared to EBITDA of $213 million for full-year 2021.\n\n“CVR Partners reported strong results for the full-year 2022 despite planned turnarounds at both nitrogen fertilizer production facilities,” said Mark Pytosh, Chief Executive Officer of CVR Partners’ general partner. “After the successful completion of the turnarounds, we have achieved record monthly production rates at both facilities.\n\n“Grain prices are near 10-year highs and planted corn acres are expected to increase by 3 percent to 5 percent for the spring 2023 planting season, driving strong demand for nitrogen fertilizer,” Pytosh said. “With no planned turnarounds until fall 2024 and the strengthening of our balance sheet completed earlier in 2022, the Partnership will continue to focus on maintaining financial flexibility and generating free cash flow.”\n\nStory continues\n\nConsolidated Operations\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022, CVR Partners’ average realized gate prices for UAN improved by 31 percent to $455 per ton and ammonia improved by 30 percent to $967 per ton when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $347 per ton and $745 per ton, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nCVR Partners’ fertilizer facilities produced a combined 210,000 tons of ammonia during the fourth quarter of 2022, of which 75,000 net tons were available for sale, while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 308,000 tons of UAN. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the fertilizer facilities produced a combined 197,000 tons of ammonia, of which 70,000 net tons were available for sale, while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 288,000 tons of UAN.\n\nFor full-year 2022, the average realized gate price for UAN improved by 84 percent to $486 per ton and ammonia improved 88 percent to $1,024 per ton when compared to full-year 2021. Average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $264 per ton and $544 per ton, respectively, for full-year 2021.\n\nCVR Partners’ fertilizer facilities produced a combined 703,000 tons of ammonia for full-year 2022, of which 213,000 net tons were available for sale, while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 1,140,000 tons of UAN. For full-year 2021, the fertilizer facilities produced a combined 807,000 tons of ammonia, of which 275,000 net tons were available for sale, while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 1,208,000 tons of UAN.\n\nCapital Structure\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Partnership repurchased 111,695 and 24,378 of its common units, respectively, on the open market pursuant to a repurchase program (the “Unit Repurchase Program”) approved by the board of directors of the Partnership’s general partner (the “Board”) and in accordance with a repurchase agreement under Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a cost of $12.4 million and $528,729, respectively, exclusive of transaction costs, or an average price of $110.98 and $21.69, respectively, per common unit. As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership had a nominal authorized amount remaining under the Unit Repurchase Program. This Unit Repurchase Program does not obligate the Partnership to acquire any common units and may be cancelled or terminated by the Board at any time.\n\nOn February 22, 2022, the Partnership redeemed the remaining $65 million outstanding balance of the 9.25% Senior Secured Notes, due June 2023 at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nDistributions\n\nCVR Partners announced that the Board declared a fourth quarter 2022 cash distribution of $10.50 per common unit, which will be paid on March 13, 2023, to common unitholders of record as of March 6, 2023.\n\nCVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices received for its finished products, maintenance capital expenditures, use of cash and cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call\n\nCVR Partners previously announced that it will host its fourth quarter and full-year 2022 Earnings Conference Call on Wednesday, February 22, at 11 a.m. Eastern. This Earnings Conference Call may also include discussion of the Partnership’s developments, forward-looking information and other material information about business and financial matters.\n\nThe fourth quarter and full-year 2022 Earnings Conference Call will be webcast live and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of CVR Partners’ website at www.CVRPartners.com.

CVR Partners may use these channels to distribute material information about the Partnership and to communicate important information about the Partnership, corporate initiatives and other matters. Information that CVR Partners posts on its website could be deemed material; therefore, CVR Partners encourages investors, the media, its customers, business partners and others interested in the Partnership to review the information posted on its website.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nInvestor Relations:\r\nRichard Roberts\r\nCVR Partners, LP\r\n(281) 207-3205\r\nInvestorRelations@CVRPartners.com\n\nMedia Relations:\r\nBrandee Stephens\r\nCVR Partners, LP\r\n(281) 207-3516\r\nMediaRelations@CVRPartners.com\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\n\nOur management uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, and reconciliations to those measures, to evaluate current and past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below.\n\nThe following are non-GAAP measures we present for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\nEBITDA - Net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for certain significant non-cash items and items that management believes are not attributable to or indicative of our on-going operations or that may obscure our underlying results and trends.\n\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities to EBITDA - Net cash provided by operating activities reduced by (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), (iii) change in working capital, and (iv) other non-cash adjustments.\n\nAvailable Cash for Distribution - EBITDA for the quarter excluding non-cash income or expense items (if any), for which adjustment is deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board in its sole discretion, less (i) reserves for maintenance capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, and (ii) reserves for future operating or capital needs (if any), in each case, that the Board deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, and other excess cash, at the discretion of the Board.\n\nWe present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders, and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our GAAP results, including, but not limited to, our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the fertilizer industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods, and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” included herein for reconciliation of these amounts. Due to rounding, numbers presented within this section may not add or equal to numbers or totals presented elsewhere within this document.\n\nFactors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results\n\nOur historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below.\n\nMajor Scheduled Turnaround Activities\n\nCoffeyville Facility - A planned turnaround at the Coffeyville Facility commenced in July 2022 and was completed in mid-August 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred turnaround expense of $12.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred turnaround expense of $0.3 million related to planning for the Coffeyville Facility’s turnaround completed during the third quarter of 2022. During the planning and execution of this turnaround, the Partnership updated the estimated useful lives of certain assets, which resulted in additional depreciation expense of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Coffeyville Facility had planned downtime during the fourth quarter of 2021 at a cost of $2.0 million.\n\nEast Dubuque Facility - A planned turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility commenced in August 2022 and was completed in mid-September 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred turnaround expense of $21.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred turnaround expense of $0.6 million related to planning for the East Dubuque Facility’s turnaround completed during the third quarter of 2022. During the planning and execution of this turnaround, the Partnership updated the estimated useful lives of certain assets, which resulted in additional depreciation expense of $6.4 million and $4.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nCVR Partners, LP\r\n(unaudited)\n\nConsolidated Statement of Operations Data\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nDecember 31, Year Ended\r\nDecember 31, (in thousands, except per unit data) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales(1) $ 212,233 $ 188,921 $ 835,584 $ 532,581 Operating costs and expenses: Cost of materials and other 30,602 28,371 130,913 98,345 Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 51,980 60,088 270,167 198,714 Depreciation and amortization 19,324 20,833 82,137 73,480 Cost of sales 101,906 109,292 483,217 370,539 Selling, general and administrative expenses 8,336 7,303 32,192 26,615 (Gain) loss on asset disposal (3 ) 472 263 948 Operating income 101,994 71,854 319,912 134,479 Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (7,825 ) (10,414 ) (34,065 ) (60,978 ) Other income, net 952 87 1,114 4,711 Income before income tax expense 95,121 61,527 286,961 78,212 Income tax (benefit) expense (245 ) 37 160 57 Net income $ 95,366 $ 61,490 $ 286,801 $ 78,155 Basic and diluted earnings per common unit $ 9.02 $ 5.76 $ 27.07 $ 7.31 Distributions declared per common unit 1.77 2.93 19.32 4.65 EBITDA* $ 122,270 $ 92,774 $ 403,163 $ 212,670 Available cash for distribution* 110,987 55,956 259,735 96,557 Weighted-average common units outstanding: Basic and Diluted 10,570 10,681 10,593 10,685\n\n* See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section below for a reconciliation of these amounts.\n\n(1)   Below are the components of net sales:\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nDecember 31, Year Ended\r\nDecember 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Components of net sales: Fertilizer sales $ 200,551 $ 179,003 $ 789,548 $ 490,900 Freight in revenue 8,258 7,186 34,770 31,419 Other 3,424 2,732 11,266 10,262 Total net sales $ 212,233 $ 188,921 $ 835,584 $ 532,581\n\nSelected Balance Sheet Data\n\n(in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 86,339 $ 112,516 Working capital 139,647 100,385 Total assets 1,100,402 1,127,058 Total debt, including current portion 546,800 610,642 Total liabilities 688,591 784,860 Total partners’ capital 411,811 342,198\n\nSelected Cash Flow Data\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nDecember 31, Year Ended\r\nDecember 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net cash flows (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ (2,771 ) $ 68,458 $ 301,464 $ 188,725 Investing activities (11,222 ) (10,136 ) (44,623 ) (20,342 ) Financing activities (18,709 ) (46,474 ) (283,018 ) (86,426 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (32,702 ) $ 11,848 $ (26,177 ) $ 81,957\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nDecember 31, Year Ended\r\nDecember 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Maintenance $ 2,141 $ 8,803 $ 40,793 $ 16,226 Growth 51 3,356 653 9,460 Total capital expenditures $ 2,192 $ 12,159 $ 41,446 $ 25,686\n\nKey Operating Data\n\nAmmonia Utilization (1)\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nDecember 31, Year Ended\r\nDecember 31, (percent of capacity utilization) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Consolidated 96 % 90 % 81 % 92 %\n\n(1)   Reflects our ammonia utilization rates on a consolidated basis and at each of our facilities. Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Partnership’s facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity. We present our utilization for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and take into account the impact of our current turnaround cycles on any specific period. Additionally, we present utilization solely on ammonia production rather than each nitrogen product as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of plant configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products.

(NYSE: GFL) (TSX: GFL) (\"GFL\", \"we\", \"our\" or the \"Company\") today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, as well as guidance for full year 2023. GFL Environmental Inc. Logo (CNW Group/GFL Environmental Inc.)\n\n\"Our employees delivered another exceptional year of results, outperforming our previously increased full year 2022 guidance,\" said Patrick Dovigi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of GFL. \"In 2022, strong execution drove our achievement of double digit, industry-leading revenue growth, including our highest to date Solid Waste core pricing increase of 9.9% for the fourth quarter, continued volume growth and acquisitions that outperformed expectations. We also grew Adjusted EBITDA2 for the quarter by 17.0% and demonstrated the effectiveness of our pricing and efficiency initiatives to counteract continuing inflationary cost pressures, resulting in organic Adjusted EBITDA margin2 expansion of 125 basis points, excluding the impact of fuel and commodity prices. Going into 2023, we believe with a high degree of visibility that the continued implementation of these initiatives will result in significant opportunities for outsized margin expansion.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMr. Dovigi continued, \"Driving operating leverage through our continued focus on pricing, improved asset utilization and cost optimization continues to be a top priority for 2023. The better-than-expected pricing momentum exiting 2022 allows us to begin 2023 with double digit pricing and positions us for over 100 basis points of Adjusted EBITDA margin2 expansion in the year, despite over 70 basis points of headwinds from commodity prices and the dilutive rollover impact of acquisitions. Any improvement to commodity prices during the year would provide incremental upside to our guidance. The ongoing development of our 21 RNG projects is another key priority for 2023. Although the in-year contribution from these projects is modest, they are expected to generate approximately $175 million of Run-Rate EBITDA2 by the end of 2025, which would result in approximately 140 basis points of incremental Adjusted EBITDA margin2 expansion.\"\n\n\"While we continue to manage a robust M&A pipeline, we intend to focus on realizing further synergies and opportunities from recent acquisitions. As a result, we expect a more tempered level of M&A in 2023, deploying approximately $300 million to $500 million on tuck-in acquisitions, returning to more historical levels of M&A in 2024.\"\n\n\"We continue to focus on rationalizing our portfolio of assets in order to maximize return on invested capital. We have identified three distinct U.S. Solid Waste regions for potential sale that we acquired as part of several recent larger acquisitions. We believe that these divestitures could result in gross proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, the net proceeds of which could reduce Net Leverage2 to below 4.0x, positioning us for sustainable industry leading free cash flow growth over the mid-term. We have signed three letters of intent for these divestitures and expect to sign definitive agreements by the second quarter and close the transactions by the end of the third quarter.\"\n\n\"I am particularly proud of the meaningful advancements we made during the year on our ESG commitments. We published our 2021 Sustainability Report and established our Sustainability Action Plan which formalized our targets, goals and commitments. We received the NWRA 2022 Recycling Facility of the Year award for our Toronto Multi-Material Recovery Campus, the second time in the last three years that one of our MRFs has received this honor. Our continued ability to be a leading provider of sustainable solutions is a credit to the passion for our business of our almost 20,000 employees.\"\n\nMr. Dovigi concluded, \"December 2022 was the 15th anniversary of the founding of GFL. In those 15 years, we have remained committed to implementing our fundamental priorities. This singular focus on creating value for our stakeholders is the foundation for our industry-leading performance in 2022 and our launch into 2023. I am excited about the many opportunities that still lie ahead of us.\"\n\nFourth Quarter Results1\n\nRevenue increased by 26.5% to $1,821.2 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Environmental Services revenue of $328.5 million, including organic growth of 27.3% driven by higher industrial collection and processing activity at our facilities and an increased level of emergency response activity. Adjusted EBITDA2 increased by 17.0% to $439.8 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margin2 was 24.1%, compared to 25.2% for the fourth quarter of 2021 (26.1% as adjusted for the divestiture of GFL Infrastructure). Solid Waste Adjusted EBITDA margin2 was 28.2%, compared to 30.0% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net loss from continuing operations increased to $219.1 million, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $81.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted Free Cash Flow2 was $221.1 million, compared to $188.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nYear to Date Results1\n\nRevenue increased by 31.6% to $6,761.3 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Environmental Services revenue of $1,248.9 million, including organic growth of 27.9% driven by higher industrial collection and processing activity at our facilities, an increased level of emergency response activity and the impact of higher used motor oil selling prices. Adjusted EBITDA2 increased by 22.0% to $1,720.8 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA margin2 was 25.5%, compared to 26.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 (27.5% as adjusted for the divestiture of GFL Infrastructure). Solid Waste Adjusted EBITDA margin2 was 29.0%, compared to 30.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net loss from continuing operations decreased to $183.2 million, compared to $627.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted Free Cash Flow2 was $691.3 million, compared to $573.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nFull Year 2023 Guidance3\n\nGFL also provided its guidance for 2023.\n\nRevenue is estimated to be between $7,550 million and $7,650 million, representing year-over-year growth of 12% to 13%, resulting from expected organic growth of approximately 6.4% to 7.3%, revenue from net M&A roll over of approximately 3.5% to 4.0% and changes in foreign exchange resulting in approximately 1.8% revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA3 is estimated to be between $2,000 million and $2,050 million, assuming Adjusted EBITDA margin3 of 26.5% to 26.8%. Adjusted Free Cash Flow3 is estimated to be approximately $700 million, inclusive of approximately $50 million of capex spend from 2022 resulting from timing delays and incremental cash interest of approximately $100 million from the annualized impact of higher interest rates. Net Leverage3 is estimated to be approximately 4.2x, resulting from growth in Adjusted EBITDA3 and Adjusted Free Cash Flow3 generation.\n\nThe 2023 guidance includes the expected contribution of acquisitions already completed but excludes any impact from acquisitions not yet completed, refinancing opportunities, divestitures of non-core Solid Waste operations and any potential redeployment of capital. Implicit in forward-looking information in our expectations for 2023 are certain current assumptions, including, among others, no changes to the current economic environment, including fuel and commodities. The 2023 guidance assumes GFL will continue to execute on its strategy to organically grow the business by leveraging its scalable network to attract and retain customers across multiple service lines, realize operational efficiencies and extract procurement and cost synergies. See \"Forward-Looking Information\".\n\nGFL is considering the potential sale of certain non-core Solid Waste operations in the United States with a view to optimizing its portfolio. The full year 2023 guidance does not include the impact of these potential divestitures which could result in approximately $1,500 million of gross proceeds. These potential divestitures are expected to be accretive to Adjusted Free Cash Flow3 driven by annualized cash interest savings of approximately $100 million4 and annualized capex reduction of approximately $30 million to $35 million, which could result in estimated Net Leverage in the high 3x5 for 2023.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\n\nGFL views its Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") efforts as integral to its business, with initiatives consistent with its objective of long-term value creation for all stakeholders. In 2022, we released our 2021 Sustainability Report and established our Sustainability Action Plan which lays out a clear path to achieving our long-term goals, targets and commitments. Our Sustainability Action Plan is focused on the health, safety and engagement of our employees, increasing our recyclables recovered at our material recovery facilities, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions including through increased landfill gas capture and reuse, promoting and conserving biodiversity and investing in our communities through our Full Circle Project.

Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts nor assurances of future performance but instead represent management's expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events or circumstances.\n\nForward-looking information is based on our opinions, estimates and assumptions that we considered appropriate and reasonable as of the date such information is stated, is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to certain assumptions set out herein in the section titled \"Full Year 2023 Guidance\"; our ability to obtain and maintain existing financing on acceptable terms; our ability to source and execute on acquisitions on terms acceptable to us; our ability to find purchasers for non-core assets and to complete such divestitures on terms acceptable to us; currency exchange and interest rates; commodity price fluctuations; our ability to implement price increases and surcharges; changes in waste volumes; labour, supply chain and transportation constraints; inflationary cost pressures; fuel supply and fuel price fluctuations; our ability to maintain a favourable working capital position; the impact of competition; the changes and trends in our industry or the global economy; changes in laws, rules, regulations, and global standards; and the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including variants, and its impact on the economy, the North American financial markets, our operations, our M&A pipeline and our financial results. Other important factors that could materially affect our forward-looking information can be found in the \"Risk Factors\" section of GFL's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2022 and GFL's other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these risks carefully in evaluating our forward-looking information and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such information. There can be no assurance that the underlying opinions, estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. Although we have attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking information. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. The forward-looking information contained in this release represents our expectations as of the date of this release (or as the date it is otherwise stated to be made), and is subject to change after such date. However, we disclaim any intention or obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable U.S. or Canadian securities laws. The purpose of disclosing our financial outlook set out in this release is to provide investors with more information concerning the financial impact of our business initiatives and growth strategies.\n\nNon-IFRS Measures\n\nThis release makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. Rather, these non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation.\n\nEBITDA represents, for the applicable period, net income (loss) from continuing operations plus (a) interest and other finance costs, plus (b) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, landfill assets and intangible assets, plus (less) (c) the provision (recovery) for income taxes, in each case to the extent deducted or added to/from net income (loss) from continuing operations. We present EBITDA to assist readers in understanding the mathematical development of Adjusted EBITDA. Management does not use EBITDA as a financial performance metric.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by management and other users of our financial statements including our lenders and investors, to assess the financial performance of our business without regard to financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA is also a key metric that management uses prior to execution of any strategic investing or financing opportunity. For example, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in determining the value of acquisitions, expansion opportunities and dispositions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is utilized by financial institutions to measure borrowing capacity. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding and deducting, as applicable from EBITDA, certain expenses, costs, charges or benefits incurred in such period which in management's view are either not indicative of underlying business performance or impact the ability to assess the operating performance of our business, including: (a) (gain) loss on foreign exchange, (b) (gain) loss on sale of property and equipment, (c) mark-to-market (gain) loss on Purchase Contracts, (d) share of net income of investments accounted for using the equity method, (e) share-based payments, (f) gain (loss) on divestiture, (g) transaction costs, (h) acquisition, rebranding and other integration costs (included in cost of sales related to acquisition activity), and (i) impairment and other. We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis reflecting factors and trends affecting our business. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we deducted our share of net income of investments accounted for using the equity method and adjusted for an impairment charge and insurance recoveries related to assets that were destroyed by fire during the year. As we continue to grow our business, we may be faced with new events or circumstances that are not indicative of our underlying business performance or that impact the ability to assess our operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Management and other users of our financial statements including our lenders and investors use Adjusted EBITDA margin to facilitate a comparison of the operating performance of each of our operating segments on a consistent basis reflecting factors and trends affecting our business.\n\nAcquisition EBITDA represents, for the applicable period, management's estimates of the annual Adjusted EBITDA of an acquired business, based on its most recently available historical financial information at the time of acquisition, as adjusted to give effect to (a) the elimination of expenses related to the prior owners and certain other costs and expenses that are not indicative of the underlying business performance, if any, as if such business had been acquired on the first day of such period (\"Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments\"), and (b) contract and acquisition annualization for contracts entered into and acquisitions completed by such acquired business prior to our acquisition. Further adjustments are made to such annual Adjusted EBITDA to reflect estimated operating cost savings and synergies, if any, anticipated to be realized upon acquisition 4 and integration of the business into our operations. We use Acquisition EBITDA for the acquired businesses to adjust our Adjusted EBITDA to include a proportional amount of the Acquisition EBITDA of the acquired businesses based upon the respective number of months of operation for such period prior to the date of our acquisition of each such business.\n\nAdjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities represents cash flows from operating activities adjusted for (a) operating cash flows from discontinued operations, (b) prepayment penalties for early note redemption, (c) transaction costs, (d) acquisition, rebranding and other integration costs, (e) M&A related net working capital investment, (f) tax refund from CARES Act, and (g) cash interest paid on TEUs. Management uses Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of GFL. Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities is a supplemental measure used by investors as a valuation and liquidity measure in our industry.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow represents Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities adjusted for (a) proceeds from asset divestitures, (b) normalization for excess proceeds from asset divestitures, (c) proceeds on disposal of assets, (d) purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets, and (e) investment in joint ventures and associates. For the year ended December 31, 2022, proceeds from asset divestitures excluded proceeds received for the divestiture of GFL Infrastructure. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure used by investors as a valuation and liquidity measure in our industry. Management uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of GFL.\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) from continuing operations represents net income (loss) for continuing operations adjusted for (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) ARO discount rate depreciation adjustment, (c) incremental depreciation of property and equipment due to recapitalization, (d) prepayment penalties for early note redemption, (e) amortization of deferred financing costs, (f) (gain) loss on foreign exchange, (g) mark-to-market (gain) loss on Purchase Contracts, (h) share of net income of investments accounted for using the equity method, (i) gain (loss) on divestiture, (j) transaction costs, (k) acquisition, rebranding and other integration costs, (l) TEU amortization expense, (m) impairment and other, and (n) the tax impact of the forgoing. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we deducted our share of net income of investments accounted for using the equity method and adjusted for an impairment charge and insurance recoveries related to assets that were destroyed by fire during the year. Adjusted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) from continuing operations divided by the weighted average shares in the period. We believe that Adjusted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations provides a meaningful comparison of current results to prior periods' results by excluding items that GFL does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance.\n\nNet Leverage is a supplemental measure used by management to evaluate borrowing capacity and capital allocation strategies. Net Leverage is equal to our total long-term debt, as adjusted for fair value, deferred financings and other adjustments and reduced by our cash, divided by Run-Rate EBITDA.\n\nRun-Rate EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable period as adjusted to give effect to management's estimates of (a) Acquisition EBITDA Adjustments (as defined above) and (b) the impact of annualization of certain new municipal and disposal contracts and cost savings initiatives, entered into, commenced or implemented, as applicable, in such period, as if such contracts or costs savings initiatives had been entered into, commenced or implemented, as applicable, on the first day of such period. Run-Rate EBITDA has not been adjusted to take into account the impact of the cancellation of contracts and cost increases associated with these contracts. These adjustments reflect monthly allocations of Acquisition EBITDA for the acquired businesses based on straight line proration. As a result, these estimates do not take into account the seasonality of a particular acquired business. While we do not believe the seasonality of any one acquired business is material when aggregated with other acquired businesses, the estimates may result in a higher or lower adjustment to our Run-Rate EBITDA than would have resulted had we adjusted for the actual results of each of the acquired businesses for the period prior to our acquisition. We primarily use Run-Rate EBITDA to show how GFL would have performed if each of the interim acquisitions had been consummated at the start of the period as well as to show the impact of the annualization of certain new municipal and disposal contracts and cost savings initiatives. We also believe that Run-Rate EBITDA is useful to investors and creditors to monitor and evaluate our borrowing capacity and compliance with certain of our debt covenants. Run-Rate EBITDA as presented herein is calculated in accordance with the terms of our revolving credit agreement.\n\nAll references to \"$\" in this press release are to Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted.\n\nFor further information:\r\nPatrick Dovigi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer,\r\n+1 905-326-0101\r\npdovigi@gflenv.com\n\nGFL Environmental Inc.

      "content": "AUSTIN, Texas, February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Q2 Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:QTWO), a leading provider of digital transformation solutions for banking and lending, today announced results for its fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2022.\n\nGAAP Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of $146.5 million, up 11 percent year-over-year and up 1 percent from the third quarter of 2022. Full-year 2022 revenue of $565.7 million, up 13 percent year-over-year. GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 45.2 percent, up from 45.1 percent for the prior-year quarter and down from 46.2 percent for the third quarter of 2022. GAAP gross margin for full-year 2022 of 45.3 percent, up from 45.1 percent for the full-year 2021. GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of $32.4 million, compared to GAAP net losses of $25.4 million for the prior-year quarter and $27.8 million for the third quarter of 2022. GAAP net loss for full-year 2022 of $109.0 million, compared to $112.7 million for full-year 2021.\n\nNon-GAAP Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022\n\nNon-GAAP revenue for the fourth quarter of $146.7 million, up 11 percent year-over-year and up 1 percent from the third quarter of 2022. Full-year 2022 non-GAAP revenue of $566.3 million, up 13 percent year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 51.5 percent, consistent with the prior-year quarter and down from 52.1 percent for the third quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin for full-year 2022 of 51.6 percent, down from 51.9 percent for full-year 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of $8.4 million, down from $10.8 million for the prior-year quarter and $10.8 million for the third quarter of 2022. Full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $36.9 million down from $37.9 million for the full-year 2021.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, the company executed a mutual termination of a contract with an international alternative finance customer. This resulted in a negative impact to revenue of $3.1 million and a negative impact to adjusted EBITDA of $3.9 million for the fourth quarter. Please see the table at the end of the financial table below for more information regarding these impacts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results, please see the tables below.\n\n\"We closed out the year with strong execution across the business and believe we have positioned ourselves well to accelerate subscription revenue growth and improve profitability,\" said Q2 CEO Matt Flake. \"Our fourth quarter was the largest sales quarter in company history, with several Tier 1 and Enterprise deals across the business, and I was particularly pleased with our digital banking performance in the Tier 2 space. Our continued sales success and emphasis on cost management give me confidence in our ability to drive sustained growth and margin expansion for 2023 and beyond.\"\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nContinued Sales Success Across the Business\n\nSigned a Tier 1 digital banking contract to utilize our commercial and SMB banking solutions. Signed a Tier 2 digital banking contract, our largest single deal in the quarter, to utilize our retail, small business, and commercial solutions. Signed two enterprise and two Tier 1 digital lending contracts to utilize our loan pricing solutions, including:\n\nAn expansion with an Enterprise, Top 10 U.S. bank; An expansion with an Enterprise, Top 5 Canadian bank; and Two New Tier 1 U.S. banks. Signed multiple digital loan & leasing contracts including a leasing agreement with a multinational auto manufacturer. Signed a multi-year renewal with one of our largest Helix customers.\n\nStrong Year-End Results due to Sales and Operational Execution\n\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue increased to $655.2 million, up 14% year-over-year from $574.2 million at the end of 2021. Remaining Performance Obligation total, or Backlog, increased by $104 million sequentially, resulting in total committed Backlog of approximately $1.5 billion at quarter-end, representing 6% year-over-year growth and 7% sequential growth. Exited the fourth quarter with approximately 21.1 million registered users on the Q2 digital banking platform, representing 10% year-over-year growth.\n\n\"We had a strong performance during the quarter across numerous financial metrics,\" said David Mehok, Q2 CFO. \"We generated record cash flow from operations for the quarter of $43.9 million and we finished with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $433.4 million. Through a continued focus on margin accretive growth opportunities, efficiencies and enhanced productivity initiatives, we believe we have positioned ourselves to drive meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin and cash flow expansion in 2023.\"\n\nFinancial outlook\n\nAs of February 21, 2023, Q2 Holdings is providing guidance for its first quarter of 2023 and full-year 2023, which represents Q2 Holdings’ current estimates on Q2 Holdings’ operations and financial results. The financial information below represents forward-looking, non-GAAP financial information, including estimates of non-GAAP revenue and adjusted EBITDA. GAAP net loss is the most comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, interest and other (income) expense, income taxes, lease and other restructuring charges, partnership termination charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting. Q2 Holdings is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Q2 Holdings has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss. However, it is important to note that these excluded items could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP in future periods.\n\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for its first quarter of 2023 as follows:\n\nTotal non-GAAP revenue of $149.0 million to $152.0 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 11 to 13 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of $10.0 million to $12.5 million, representing 7 to 8 percent of non-GAAP revenue for the quarter.\n\nQ2 Holdings is providing guidance for the full-year 2023 as follows:\n\nTotal non-GAAP revenue of $632.0 million to $640.0 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 12 percent to 13 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of $62.0 million to $66.0 million, representing approximately 10 percent of non-GAAP revenue for the year.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nDate: Tuesday, February 21, 2023 Time: 5:00 p.m. ET Hosts: Matt Flake, CEO / David Mehok, CFO / Jonathan Price, EVP Emerging Businesses, Corporate & Business Development Webcast Registration: https://conferencingportals.com/event/ZwJrtqJb Conference Call Registration: https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/845775123\n\nAll participants must register using either of the links above (webcast or conference call).

Q2 has used, and intends to continue to use, its investor relations website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nAbout Q2 Holdings, Inc.\n\nQ2 is a financial experience company dedicated to providing digital banking and lending solutions to banks, credit unions, alternative finance, and fintech companies in the U.S. and internationally. With comprehensive end-to-end solution sets, Q2 enables its partners to provide cohesive, secure, data-driven experiences to every account holder – from consumer to small business and corporate.

To learn more, please visit Q2.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\n\nQ2 uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue; adjusted EBITDA; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP gross profit; non-GAAP sales and marketing expense; non-GAAP research and development expense; non-GAAP general and administrative expense; non-GAAP operating expense; non-GAAP operating income (loss); non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP net income per share; and non-GAAP diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of operating performance because they exclude items that Q2 does not consider indicative of its core performance.\n\nIn the case of non-GAAP revenue, Q2 adjusts revenue to exclude the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting adjustments. In the case of adjusted EBITDA, Q2 adjusts net loss for such items as interest and other (income) expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, lease and other restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting. In the case of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit, Q2 adjusts gross profit and gross margin for stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired technology, acquisition related costs, the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting, and lease and other restructuring charges. In the case of non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, and non-GAAP general and administrative expense, Q2 adjusts the corresponding GAAP expense to exclude stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP Operating Expense is calculated by taking the sum of non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expense, and non-GAAP general and administrative expense. In the case of non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, Q2 adjusts operating loss and net loss, respectively, for stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangibles, lease and other restructuring charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and the impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting, and with respect to non-GAAP net income, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. In the case of non-GAAP diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, Q2 adjusts diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding by the weighted-average effect of potentially dilutive shares which include (i) employee equity incentive plans, excluding the impact of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense and (ii) convertible senior notes outstanding and related warrants including the anti-dilutive impact of note hedge and capped call agreements on convertible senior notes outstanding.\n\nThere are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Certain items that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on operating and net income (loss). As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, the closest GAAP measures, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the closest GAAP measures of these non-GAAP measures is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nQ2’s management uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance; to prepare Q2’s annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of Q2’s business; to evaluate the effectiveness of Q2’s business strategies; to provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance; to facilitate a comparison of Q2’s results with those of other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and in communication with our board of directors concerning Q2’s financial performance.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements about: our ability to accelerate subscription revenue growth and improve profitability; our continued sales success and emphasis on cost management; our ability to drive sustained growth and margin expansion for 2023 and beyond; our continued focus on margin accretive growth opportunities, efficiencies and enhanced productivity initiatives; our ability to drive meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin and cash flow expansion in 2023; and, Q2’s quarterly and annual financial guidance.

(m) the challenges and costs associated with selling, implementing and supporting our solutions, particularly for larger customers with more complex requirements and longer implementation processes, including risks related to the timing and predictability of sales of our solutions and the impact that the timing of bookings may have on our revenue and financial performance in a period; (n) the risk that errors, interruptions or delays in our solutions or Web hosting negatively impacts our business and sales; (o) the risks associated with cyberattacks, data and privacy breaches and breaches of security measures within our products, systems and infrastructure or the products, systems and infrastructure of third parties upon which we rely and the resultant costs and liabilities and harm to our business and reputation and our ability to sell our solutions; (p) the difficulties and risks associated with developing and selling complex new solutions and enhancements with the technical and regulatory specifications and functionality required by our customers and relevant governmental authorities; (q) regulatory risks, including risks related to evolving regulation of artificial intelligence, machine learning and the receipt, collection, storage, processing and transfer of data; (r) the risks associated with our sales and marketing capabilities, including partner relationships and the length, cost and unpredictability of our sales cycle; (s) the risks inherent in third-party technology and implementation partnerships that could cause harm to our business; (t) the risk that we will not be able to maintain historical contract terms such as pricing and duration; (u) the general risks associated with the complexity of our customer arrangements and our solutions; (v) the risks associated with integrating acquired companies and successfully selling and maintaining their solutions; (w) litigation related to intellectual property and other matters and any related claims, negotiations and settlements; (x) the risks associated with further consolidation in the financial services industry; (y) risks associated with selling our solutions internationally and with expanding our international operations; and (z) the risk that our debt repayment obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations in the future and that we may not be able to obtain capital when desired or needed on favorable terms.\n\nAdditional information relating to the uncertainty affecting the Q2 business is contained in Q2’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

      "title": "Transocean Ltd. Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results",
      "content": "Total contract drilling revenues were $606 million, compared to $691 million in the third quarter of 2022 (total adjusted contract drilling revenues of $625 million, compared to $730 million in the third quarter of 2022);  Revenue efficiency(1) was 98.0%, compared to 95.0% in the prior quarter; Operating and maintenance expense was $423 million, compared to $411 million in the prior period; Net loss attributable to controlling interest was $350 million, $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $28 million, $0.04 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2022; Adjusted EBITDA was $140 million, compared to $268 million in the prior quarter; and Contract backlog was $8.5 billion as of the February 2023 Fleet Status Report.\n\nSTEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, Feb. 21, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) today reported a net loss attributable to controlling interest of $350 million, $0.48 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2022.\n\nFourth quarter results included net favorable items of $6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share as follows:\n\n$5 million, $0.01 per diluted share, discrete tax items; and $1 million gain on retirement of debt.\n\nAfter consideration of these net favorable items, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted net loss was $356 million, $0.49 per diluted share.\n\nContract drilling revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022, decreased sequentially by $85 million to $606 million, primarily due to reduced activity for five rigs that were idle in the fourth quarter, partially offset by higher revenue efficiency and revenues earned by the newbuild ultra-deepwater floater Deepwater Atlas, which commenced operations in October 2022.\n\nContract intangible amortization represented a non-cash revenue reduction of $19 million. The reduction, compared to $39 million in the prior period, resulted from the accelerated recognition of remaining contract intangible for Transocean Equinox following the customer’s early termination of the drilling contract in the third quarter 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating and maintenance expense was $423 million, compared with $411 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher maintenance cost across our fleet and the commencement of operations of the newbuild Deepwater Atlas, partially offset by reduced activity from rigs that became idle in the fourth quarter.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense was $55 million, up from $42 million in the third quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs and increased legal, professional fees and advisory fees.\n\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was $263 million, compared with $96 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to a non-cash loss of $157 million associated with a fair value adjustment of the bifurcated exchange feature embedded in our exchangeable bonds issued in the third quarter. Interest income was $12 million, compared with $9 million in the previous quarter.\n\nThe Effective Tax Rate(2) was (11.0)% in the current quarter and 16.3% in the prior quarter. The change in the rate was primarily due to incurring over half of the actual earnings for the year in the current quarter. The Effective Tax Rate excluding discrete items was (12.6)% compared to (1.2)% in the previous quarter.\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $178 million, compared to $230 million in the prior quarter. The sequential decrease is primarily due to increased payments for accounts payable and income taxes, partially offset by the timing of interest payments.\n\nFourth quarter 2022 capital expenditures of $409 million, compared to $87 million in the prior quarter, were primarily related to our newbuild drillships under construction, including the cash component of the final milestone payment for the delivery of Deepwater Titan in December 2022.\n\n“Looking back, 2022 will be remembered as a pivotal year in Transocean’s history,” said Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy Thigpen. “During the year, we continued to high-grade our fleet through the deployment of innovative technologies and the delivery of the industry’s only two 8th generation drillships, Deepwater Atlas and Deepwater Titan. Perhaps most importantly, we secured approximately $4 billion in incremental backlog, our largest annual backlog addition since prior to the industry downturn in 2014.”\n\nThigpen concluded, “As an industry, it is clear that we have finally emerged from eight exceptionally challenging years and are now in the early stages of what we believe will be a multi-year upcycle. To maximize value for our shareholders during this upcycle, Transocean will continue to secure high-quality backlog, maintain our acute focus on operational excellence, exercise capital discipline, and take the necessary steps to right-size our balance sheet.”\r\n\r\nFull Year 2022\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net loss attributable to controlling interest totaled $621 million, or $0.89 per diluted share. Full year results included $27 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, net favorable items listed as follows:\n\n$19 million, $0.03 per diluted share, related to discrete tax items; and $8 million, $0.01 per diluted share, gain on retirement of debt.\n\nAfter consideration of these net favorable items, adjusted net loss for 2022 was $648 million, $0.93 per diluted share.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe present our operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). We believe certain financial measures, such as Adjusted Contract Drilling Revenues, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, which are non-GAAP measures, provide users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under U.S. GAAP, can be used to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure. Such non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nAll non-GAAP measure reconciliations to the most comparative U.S. GAAP measures are displayed in quantitative schedules on the company’s website at: www.deepwater.com.\n\nAbout Transocean\n\nTransocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. The company specializes in technically demanding sectors of the global offshore drilling business with a particular focus on ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling services, and operates the highest specification floating offshore drilling fleet in the world.\n\nTransocean owns or has partial ownership interests in and operates a fleet of 37 mobile offshore drilling units consisting of 27 ultra-deepwater floaters and 10 harsh environment floaters.

The journey from startup to $1 billion in sales is certainly worthy of note and particularly so at this milestone anniversary of the company’s founding. The fourth quarter of 2022 was a record-setting quarter, with record-breaking total sales, U.S. Spine sales, and Enabling Technologies sales. Our future continues to look bright as we improve the lives of patients, surgeons, employees and shareholders by working to further achieve our vision. We plan to build on our legacy of product innovation, superior customer services, and operational execution this year and in the future as we continue to help patients with musculoskeletal disease.”\n\nWorldwide net sales for the fourth quarter were $274.5 million, an as-reported increase of 9.8% over the fourth quarter of 2021, and an increase of 11.7% on a constant currency basis.  U.S. net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by 9.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. International net sales increased by 11.4% over the fourth quarter of 2021 on an as-reported basis, and an increase of 24.2% on a constant currency basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorldwide net sales for the full year of 2022 were $1,022.8 million, an increase of 6.8% as compared to the full year of 2021, and an increase of 8.2% on a constant currency basis. U.S. net sales for the full year of 2022 increased by 6.4% compared to the full year of 2021. International net sales increased by 8.9% over the full year of 2021 on an as-reported basis, and an increase of 19.1% on a constant currency basis.\n\nGAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $50.1 million, an increase of 231.4% over the same period in the prior year, driven primarily by higher net sales and the acquisition of in-process research and development during the fourth quarter in 2021. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.49, compared to $0.14 for the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $0.59, compared to $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 20.0% driven primarily by higher net sales.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $178.5 million, and non-GAAP free cash flow was $104.4 million for the full year of 2022. The Company remains debt free.\n\n2023 Annual Guidance\n\nThe Company today announced full year stand-alone 2023 guidance with expected net sales of $1.1 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.30.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nGlobus Medical will hold a teleconference to discuss its 2022 fourth quarter and full year results with the investment community at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today.\n\nParticipants may access the conference call live via webcast on the Investors page of Globus Medical’s website at https://www.investors.globusmedical.com/news-events/events-webcasts.\n\nTo participate via telephone, please register in advance at this link.

Additional information can be accessed at www.globusmedical.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. For example, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income before interest income, net and other non-operating expenses, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for litigation, acquisition related costs/licensing, and acquisition of in-process research and development, is useful as an additional measure of operating performance, and particularly as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period, as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance, and it removes the effect of our capital structure, asset base, income taxes and interest income and expense. Our management also uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Provision for litigation represents costs incurred for litigation settlements or unfavorable verdicts when the loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, or in the case of a favorable settlement, when income is realized. Acquisition related costs/licensing represents the change in fair value of business-acquisition-related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses, including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees, as well as one-time licensing fees. Acquisition of in-process research and development represents the expensing of acquired assets with no alternative future use and related fees.\n\nIn addition, for the period ended December 31, 2022 and for other comparative periods, we are presenting non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, which represent net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the provision for litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, acquisition of in-process research and development, and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments. The tax effect adjustment represents the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the consolidated effective tax rate on a GAAP basis, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments, unless the underlying item has a materially different tax treatment, in which case the estimated tax rate applicable to the adjustment is used. We believe these non-GAAP measures are also useful indicators of our operating performance, and particularly as additional measures of comparative operating performance from period to period as they remove the effects of litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, acquisition of in-process research and development, and the tax effects of all of the foregoing adjustments, which we believe are not reflective of underlying business trends. Additionally, for the period ended December 31, 2022 and for other comparative periods, we also define the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow as the net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the impact of restricted cash, less the cash impact of purchases of property and equipment. We believe that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating our overall financial performance for comparative periods as it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations and fund acquisitions. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measure of constant currency net sales growth is calculated by translating current year net sales at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior year period. We believe constant currency net sales growth provides insight to the comparative increase or decrease in period net sales, in dollar and percentage terms, excluding the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and constant currency net sales growth are not calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures do not include certain expenses that may be necessary to evaluate our liquidity or operating results. Our definitions of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and constant currency net sales growth may differ from that of other companies and therefore may not be comparable.\n\nSafe Harbor Statements\n\nAll statements included in this press release other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and may be identified by their use of words such as “believe,” “may,” “might,” “could,” “will,” “aim,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “plan” and other similar terms.

      "content": "2022 net sales of $2.55 billion, an increase of 6% on a reported basis or 5% on an organic basis from 2021 2022 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.75, compared to $0.82 in 2021 2022 adjusted EPS of $1.41, compared to $1.38 in 2021, an increase of 2% 2022 reported net income of $186 million, compared to $203 million in 2021 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $527 million, an increase of 8% from last year on a constant currency basis 2022 cash flows from operating activities of $296 million; 2022 free cash flows of $253 million Introduces 2023 full year financial guidance:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA approximately flat on a constant currency basis Adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.43 2023 expected free cash flow of approximately $275 million\n\nMIAMI, February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Element Solutions Inc (NYSE:ESI) (\"Element Solutions\" or the \"Company\"), a global and diversified specialty chemicals company, today announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\n\nExecutive Commentary\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Gliklich commented, \"Element Solutions delivered record revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share in 2022. We outperformed our core end markets and grew organically through a persistent focus on servicing customers, pro-active price actions and prudent cost management. Our people were resilient and long-term oriented in a year characterized by short-term disruptions from war to continued COVID lockdowns. Our results were impacted by a general economic softening, raw material inflation, foreign exchange volatility, and a steep decline in consumer electronics demand in the second half. Despite these headwinds, for the full year 2022, we delivered balanced organic growth of 5% in both our business segments. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 8% on a constant currency basis. The hallmark stability of our margin and cash flows was evident once again. While we moderated discretionary spend to preserve profits, we continued to invest in our businesses through bolt-on acquisitions and capital projects. We also returned approximately $230 million to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 8 million shares at prices below our view of the intrinsic value of our Company.\"\n\nMr. Gliklich continued, \"High-end electronics demand decelerated in the second half of 2022, coinciding with lockdowns and policy shifts that drove a significant slowdown in industrial activity in China. At the same time, after two years of weakness it appears automotive end markets are slowly normalizing and our supply chain channel is clearing. We expect these dynamics to continue in the first half of 2023 and have cautious optimism - but limited visibility - into a more robust recovery in electronics demand in the second half. As a result, we expect 2023 to be more weighted to the second half than a typical year. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA growth of 1% to 3% sequentially, reflecting a continuation of late 2022 trends. Despite a slower run rate entering the year, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis for the full year. While we remain excited about the long-term growth trajectory of our business, we will not lose focus on nimbly navigating these uncertain short-term dynamics through disciplined cost management and process improvement. We continue to take actions designed to protect profits, generate free cash flow to reinvest behind our businesses and keep our company well positioned to capitalize on the compelling long term growth trends propelling our markets forward.\"\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Highlights (compared with fourth quarter 2021):\n\nNet sales on a reported basis for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $574 million, a decrease of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2021.

Bamford, Chair and CEO of Curtiss-Wright Corporation. \"In addition, we achieved record quarterly Adjusted free cash flow of nearly $300 million, which generated robust free cash flow conversion of 265%.\"\n\n\"Our full-year 2022 results were highlighted by a strong operational performance, as we produced higher sales and operating income in our Aerospace & Industrial and Naval & Power segments. Further, the strength and resilience of our combined portfolio enabled us to minimize the impact of the challenging supply chain environment, as we generated 30 basis points in full-year operating margin expansion to 17.3%, and delivered double-digit EPS growth. Our results also reflected record orders of $2.9 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.15x, driven by strong demand across the portfolio.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Looking to 2023, we anticipate total sales growth of 4% to 6% principally driven by strong growth in our A&D markets, continued operating margin expansion while maintaining steady investments in our technology, and strong Adjusted free cash flow generation ranging from $360 to $400 million. As a result, we remain well-positioned with line of sight to the 3-year financial targets that we communicated at our 2021 Investor Day.\"\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Operating Results\n\n(In millions) Q4-2022 Q4-2021 Change Reported Sales $ 758 $ 667 14 % Operating income $ 157 $ 105 49 % Operating margin 20.8 % 15.8 % 500 bps Adjusted (1) Sales $ 758 $ 655 16 % Operating income $ 160 $ 129 24 % Operating margin 21.1 % 19.7 % 140 bps\n\n(1) Reconciliations of Reported to Adjusted operating results are available in the Appendix.\n\nAdjusted sales of $758 million increased 16% compared with the prior year, and included a $9 million or 1% headwind from unfavorable foreign currency translation, mainly within our Aerospace & Industrial segment; Total A&D market sales increased 18%, while total Commercial market sales increased 10%; In our A&D markets, our results reflected strong growth of 20% in our defense markets, driven by higher defense electronics revenues, the contribution from the acquisition of our engineered arresting systems business and double-digit sales growth in commercial aerospace; In our Commercial markets, we experienced double-digit sales growth in the general industrial market, as well as high-single digit sales growth within the power & process market, despite the wind down on the China Direct AP1000 program; and Adjusted operating income of $160 million increased 24%, while Adjusted operating margin increased 140 basis points to 21.1%, principally driven by favorable overhead absorption on higher revenues in all three segments, as well as the benefits of our prior year restructuring and ongoing company-wide operational excellence initiatives.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Segment Performance\n\nAerospace & Industrial\n\n(In millions) Q4-2022 Q4-2021 Change Reported Sales $ 223 $ 210 6 % Operating income $ 41 $ 40 2 % Operating margin 18.2 % 19.0 % (80 bps) Adjusted (1) Sales $ 223 $ 208 8 % Operating income $ 41 $ 40 2 % Operating margin 18.5 % 19.5 % (100 bps)\n\n(1) Reconciliations of Reported to Adjusted operating results are available in the Appendix.\n\nAdjusted sales of $223 million, up $16 million, or 8% overall, and included a $6 million or 4% headwind from unfavorable foreign currency translation; Higher commercial aerospace market revenue was driven by higher sales of actuation and sensors products on numerous narrowbody and widebody platforms; Lower aerospace defense market revenue reflected the timing of defense market sales of our actuation and sensors products; Strong double-digit revenue growth in the general industrial market reflected continued strong demand for industrial vehicle products serving on-highway, off-highway and specialty platforms, and increased sales of surface treatment services; and Adjusted operating income was $41 million, up 2% from the prior year, while Adjusted operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 18.5%, as favorable absorption on higher sales and the benefits of our ongoing operational excellence initiatives were partially offset by unfavorable mix on actuation products.\n\nDefense Electronics\n\n(In millions) Q4-2022 Q4-2021 Change Reported Sales $ 236 $ 199 19 % Operating income $ 70 $ 52 34 % Operating margin 29.7 % 26.3 % 340 bps Adjusted (1) Sales $ 236 $ 200 18 % Operating income $ 70 $ 53 33 % Operating margin 29.7 % 26.5 % 320 bps\n\n(1) Reconciliations of Reported to Adjusted operating results are available in the Appendix.\n\nAdjusted sales of $236 million, up $37 million, or 18%, principally reflected strong growth in defense market sales, despite ongoing supply chain headwinds related to the availability of electronic components;

Higher sales were attributable to our pricing discipline, partially offset by lower demand driven by customer destocking.\n\nGross profit (exclusive of depreciation), which represents net sales less cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation), of $599.6 million decreased 5.1 percent on a reported basis and 2.5 percent on a constant currency basis(1) compared to the prior-year fourth quarter. Lower gross profit was driven primarily by higher input cost inflation and lower demand driven by customer destocking, partially offset by pricing discipline. Gross margin decreased by 220 basis points to 23.1 percent compared to the prior-year fourth quarter, primarily due to higher input cost inflation, partially offset by our pricing discipline.\n\nUnivar Solutions reported net income of $71.6 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to net income of $156.8 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in the prior-year fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher pension mark to market gains in the prior-year and lower gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), partially offset by other lower operating expenses as well as lower taxes and Warehousing, Selling and Administrative costs (\"WS&A\").\n\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share(1) of $0.47 in the quarter decreased from $0.60 in the prior-year fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower net income, partially offset by lower weighted average common shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) of $175.4 million decreased $31.7 million, or 15.3 percent, compared to the prior-year fourth quarter, or a decrease of 12.9 percent on a constant currency basis(1). The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA(1) was primarily driven by lower gross profit.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to $375.6 million from $175.2 million in the prior-year fourth quarter, primarily driven by lower net working capital use and partially offset by lower net income.\n\nLiquidity as of December 31, 2022, was $1,061 million, consisting of $385 million of cash-on-hand and availability under committed, asset-based credit facilities.\n\nOur leverage ratio(1) was 2.0x at December 31, 2022, compared to 2.1x at September 30, 2022. We define leverage ratio(1) as net debt(1) divided by last twelve months (\"LTM\") Adjusted EBITDA(1). Net debt(1) of $2,081 million at December 31, 2022 reflects total short-term and long-term debt of $2,466 million less cash and cash equivalents of $385 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, LTM net income was $545 million and LTM Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $1,048 million, as discussed in more detail in the schedules to this press release.\n\nSegment Results\n\nUSA:\n\nUSA external sales increased 5.3 percent during the quarter, primarily due to pricing discipline, partially offset by lower demand driven by customer destocking. Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) decreased by 3.4 percent, primarily due to input cost inflation and lower demand driven by customer destocking, partially offset by pricing discipline. Gross margin decreased by 220 basis points to 23.8 percent, primarily driven by input cost inflation, partially offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBITDA(1) decreased 8.9 percent to $119.0 million, driven primarily by lower gross profit and higher outbound freight and handling costs, partially offset by lower WS&A. The decrease in WS&A was primarily due to disciplined cost management and operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) decreased by 110 basis points to 7.0 percent primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower WS&A.\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and related schedules attached hereto for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related explanations of ratios or percentages, as applicable.\n\nEMEA:\n\nEMEA external sales decreased 2.5 percent on a reported basis and increased 10.2 percent on a constant currency basis(1) during the quarter. External sales increased on a constant currency basis(1), primarily due to pricing discipline, partially offset by lower demand driven by customer destocking. Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) decreased 13.5 percent, or 2.4 percent on a constant currency basis(1). Gross profit decreased primarily due to input cost inflation and lower demand driven by customer destocking, partially offset by pricing discipline. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 21.7 percent driven by input cost inflation, partially offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBITDA(1) decreased 27.5 percent to $27.4 million on a reported basis, or 18.8 percent on a constant currency basis(1), compared to the prior-year fourth quarter. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA(1) was primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower WS&A. Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) decreased by 210 basis points to 5.8 percent, primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower WS&A.\n\nCANADA:\n\nCanada external sales increased by 3.9 percent, or 12.4 percent on a constant currency basis(1) during the quarter, primarily due to pricing discipline, partially offset by lower demand driven by customer destocking. Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) decreased by 6.2 percent on a reported basis, and increased 1.8 percent on a constant currency basis(1). On a constant currency basis(1) gross profit increased primarily due to pricing discipline, partially offset by input cost inflation and lower demand driven by customer destocking. Gross margin decreased 240 basis points to 22.5 percent, largely driven by input cost inflation, partially offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBITDA(1) decreased 20.1 percent to $23.1 million on a reported basis, or 12.8 percent on a constant currency basis(1), compared to the prior-year fourth quarter. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA(1) was primarily due to lower gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) decreased by 270 basis points to 9.1 percent, primarily due to lower gross profit as well as higher WS&A as a result of increased operating costs.\n\nLATAM:\n\nLATAM external sales increased by 7.7 percent, or 4.4 percent on a constant currency basis(1) during the quarter. The increase was largely due to pricing discipline and the Sweetmix acquisition, partially offset by lower demand driven by customer destocking. Gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) increased by 4.4 percent, and remained flat on a constant currency basis(1). On a constant currency basis(1), gross profit remained flat as the benefit from pricing discipline and the Sweetmix acquisition was offset by input cost inflation and lower demand driven by customer destocking. Gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 21.1 percent largely driven by input cost inflation, partially offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 8.1 percent to $13.3 million on a reported basis or 3.3 percent on a constant currency basis(1). Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased primarily due to operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) remained flat at 7.8 percent, primarily due to operating efficiencies offsetting lower gross margin.\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and related schedules attached hereto for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related explanations of ratios or percentages, as applicable.\n\nOutlook\n\n\"We believe as a value added service provider, our customer focused business strategy positions us well to continue to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment and gives us confidence in 2023 and beyond,\" said Jukes. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA(1) to be between $200 million and $220 million for the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $319 million for the first quarter of 2022. For full-year 2023, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA(1) to be within a range of $900 million to $930 million, excluding the effects of pending acquisitions, as compared to $1,046 million for full-year 2022. Our forecast reflects anticipated continued strong operational execution, market share growth, new supplier authorizations, savings from our Value Capture Program, and disciplined cost management. Net Free Cash Flow(1) is expected to be in a range of $425 million to $445 million for full-year 2023.\n\nThe Company reaffirms its previously announced 2025 objectives and expects to deliver:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) margins of greater than 9 percent 2025 Adjusted EPS(1) greater than $4.50 50 percent Net Free Cash Flow(1) conversion Greater than 20 percent Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)(1) Maintain leverage ratio(1) between 2.0x and 2.5x Continued pursuit of accretive strategic M&A opportunities Average annual capital return to stockholders of 50 percent of Adjusted Net Income(1)\n\nThe majority of the Company's debt obligations mature in 2026 and beyond. The Company is in full compliance with the covenants under its credit agreements as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company is not providing a reconciliation of its forward-looking objectives to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure because a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts. The GAAP measures are not available due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures, such as, but not limited to, business acquisition and integration expenses, non-operating pension plan gains or losses, potential impairment charges, gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and undesignated derivative instruments, debt refinancing costs, gains or losses on divestitures, discrete tax items and other unusual or nonrecurring items that might materially impact GAAP measures. The unavailable information includes items that are evaluated on an ongoing basis, can be highly variable and cannot be reasonably predicted. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP financial results.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Details\n\nThe Company will host a webcast with investors to discuss 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results at 9:00 a.m. ET on February 22, 2023, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of its website at http://investors.univarsolutions.com. After the live webcast, a replay of the webcast will be available on the same website until February 22, 2025.\n\n(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and related schedules attached hereto for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related explanations of ratios or percentages, as applicable.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn this press release, the Company's financial results are provided both in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and using certain Non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, the Company presents the Non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit (exclusive of depreciation), gross margin (defined as gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) divided by net sales on a consolidated basis and by external sales on a segment level, as applicable), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin (defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales on a consolidated basis and by external sales on a segment level, as applicable), Adjusted net income, Adjusted earnings per diluted share, leverage ratio, net free cash flow, ROIC (defined as the last twelve months (\"LTM\") Adjusted Net Income divided by Net Assets Deployed) and results on a constant currency basis. The Non-GAAP financial measures are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these Non-GAAP financial measures help investors' ability to analyze underlying trends in the Company's business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in its industry and provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results. Additionally, the Company has used, and may continue to use, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted earnings per diluted share in setting performance incentive targets to more closely align management compensation with operational performance.\n\nThe Company evaluates its results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation is a Non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Results for periods prior to the Company's ownership have not been included in the Company's actual Consolidated Financial Statements and are included only for comparison purposes. Results included for periods prior to the Company's ownership are based on information from the prior owner of each hotel and have not been audited or adjusted.\n\nJustin Knight, Chief Executive Officer of Apple Hospitality, commented, \"Strong business and leisure demand during the fourth quarter 2022 enabled us to achieve RevPAR growth of approximately 7% as compared to the fourth quarter 2019. Consistent with earlier quarters, RevPAR growth was driven by meaningful improvement in rate. ADR for the fourth quarter 2022 was $147, approximately 12% ahead of fourth quarter 2019 ADR. We continue to work with the management teams at our hotels to maximize profitability while maintaining strong guest satisfaction necessary for sustained rate improvement. Bottom-line performance for the fourth quarter 2022 surpassed fourth quarter 2019 levels, and we believe there is additional upside for our business as corporate demand continues to improve, leisure travel remains strong and additional markets fully recover.\"\n\nMr. Knight continued, \"We are incredibly proud of our accomplishments this past year. During 2022, we bolstered the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet, we invested in staff and training, we reinstated monthly distributions, we reinvested in our hotels, and we further optimized our portfolio through the strategic acquisition of two high-quality hotels and the disposition of one non-core asset. While we remain mindful of potential macroeconomic headwinds, given the broad consumer appeal, geographic diversification and quality of our hotels, the strength and financial flexibility of our balance sheet, and the depth and experience of our team, we are confident we are well positioned for continued outperformance.\"\n\nHotel Portfolio Overview\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Apple Hospitality owned 220 hotels with an aggregate of 28,983 guest rooms located in 87 markets throughout 37 states.\n\nHighlights\n\nStrong operating performance: For the fourth quarter and full year 2022, as compared to the fourth quarter and full year 2019, the Company's portfolio achieved an improvement in RevPAR of approximately 7% and 3%, respectively, with ADR growth of approximately 12% and 9%, respectively. Occupancy was down approximately 4% and 6% for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 as compared to the same periods of 2019, respectively. Occupancy and RevPAR for the Company’s portfolio for the fourth quarter 2022 and Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for the Company's portfolio for the full year 2022 exceeded industry averages for the respective periods as reported by STR. Based on preliminary results for the Company's portfolio for the month of January 2023, occupancy was approximately 64%, up 13% as compared to January 2022, driven in part by the impact of the Omicron variant in 2022, and down 4% as compared to January 2019, with ADR growth of approximately 10% compared to January 2022 and 7% compared to January 2019. Strong bottom-line performance: The Company achieved Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA of approximately $102 million for the fourth quarter 2022 and $461 million for the full year 2022, improvements of approximately 18% and 42% as compared to the fourth quarter and full year 2021, respectively, and improvements of approximately 7% and 0.5% as compared to the fourth quarter and full year 2019, respectively.

(1) See explanation and reconciliation of Adjusted Hotel EBITDA to net income included below.\n\nPortfolio Activity\n\nAcquisitions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired two hotels, the existing 156-room AC Hotel Louisville Downtown in Louisville, Kentucky, for $51 million, or approximately $327,000 per key, and the existing 134-room AC Hotel Pittsburgh Downtown in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for $34 million, or approximately $254,000 per key.\n\nDisposition\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold one hotel, a 55-room independent boutique hotel in Richmond, Virginia, for a gross sales price of approximately $8.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $1.8 million, which is included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nContract for Potential Acquisition\n\nAs previously announced, the Company has an outstanding contract for the purchase of an Embassy Suites by Hilton in Madison, Wisconsin, for an anticipated total purchase price of approximately $79 million. The hotel is currently under development and expected to include 260 rooms. There are many conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied, and there can be no assurance that a closing on this hotel will occur under the outstanding purchase contract. Assuming all conditions to closing are met, the Company anticipates acquiring the hotel following completion of construction, which is expected to occur in early 2024.\n\nCapital Improvements\n\nApple Hospitality consistently reinvests in its hotels to maintain and enhance each property’s relevance and competitive position within its respective market. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company invested approximately $62 million in capital expenditures. The Company plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels and anticipates investing approximately $70 million to $80 million in capital improvements during 2023, which includes comprehensive renovation projects for approximately 20 to 25 hotels; however, inflationary pressures or supply chain shortages, among other issues, may result in increased costs and delays for anticipated projects.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nSummary\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $1.4 billion of total outstanding debt with a current combined weighted-average interest rate of approximately 3.9%, cash on hand of approximately $4 million, availability under its revolving credit facility of $650 million and term loan availability of $50 million, of which the remaining $50 million was drawn in January 2023. Excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments, the Company’s total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022, was comprised of approximately $329 million in property-level debt secured by 19 hotels and approximately $1.0 billion outstanding under its unsecured credit facilities. The number of unencumbered hotels in the Company’s portfolio as of December 31, 2022, was 201. Subsequent to year end, the Company repaid in full three secured mortgage loans for a total of $24 million, increasing the number of unencumbered hotels in the Company’s portfolio to 204. The Company’s total debt to total capitalization, net of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, was approximately 28%. The Company’s weighted-average debt maturities are 4.5 years.\n\nCapital Markets\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nThe Company has in place a Share Repurchase Program that provides for share repurchases in open market transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased, under its Share Repurchase Program, approximately 0.2 million of its common shares at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately $14.21 per common share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $342.3 million remaining under its Share Repurchase Program for the repurchase of shares. Shares were repurchased under a written trading plan as part of the Share Repurchase Program that provides for share repurchases in open market transactions and that is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nATM Program\n\nThe Company also has in place an at-the-market offering program (the \"ATM Program\"). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $224 million remaining under its ATM Program for the issuance of shares. No shares were sold under the ATM program during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nNon-Cash Impairment Charges\n\nDuring the fourth quarter 2022, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $26 million related to two of its hotels, the Company’s full-service Marriott in Houston, Texas, and Hilton Garden Inn in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, as a result of declines in the hotels’ current and projected cash flows.\n\nShareholder Distributions\n\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid distributions totaling $0.23 per common share. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid distributions of $0.61 per common share for a total of approximately $139.5 million. On January 17, 2023, the Company paid a regular monthly cash distribution of $0.08 per common share and a special cash distribution of $0.08 per common share, for a combined distribution of $0.16 per common share, to shareholders of record as of December 30, 2022.\n\nBased on the Company’s common stock closing price of $17.01 on February 17, 2023, the current annualized monthly cash distribution of $0.96 per common share represents an annual yield of approximately 5.6%. While the Company currently expects monthly distributions to continue, each distribution is subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors, in consultation with management, will continue to monitor the Company’s distribution rate and timing relative to the performance of its hotels, capital improvement needs, varying economic cycles, acquisitions, dispositions, other cash requirements and the Company’s REIT status for federal income tax purposes, and may make adjustments as it deems appropriate.\n\n2023 Outlook\n\nThe Company is providing its operational and financial outlook for 2023. Given the current level of visibility into future performance as a result of short-term booking windows for the Company's portfolio of rooms-focused hotels and meaningful macroeconomic uncertainty, this outlook reflects a broad range of Comparable Hotels RevPAR Change, which is the change in Comparable Hotels RevPAR in 2023 compared to 2022, and other key metrics for 2023. This outlook is based on management’s current view and does not take into account any unanticipated developments in its business or changes in its operating environment, nor does it take into account any unannounced hotel acquisitions or dispositions. Based on current trends, results for the first quarter 2023 are expected to benefit significantly from the easier comparison to the first quarter 2022 when the Omicron variant negatively impacted lodging demand. The high end of the full year range reflects relatively steady macroeconomic conditions throughout 2023, with continued strength in leisure demand and improvement in business transient. The low end of the range reflects a softening of the economy beginning in the second quarter with Comparable Hotels RevPAR Change roughly flat compared to 2022 in the second half of the year. Comparable Hotels RevPAR Change and Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin % guidance include properties acquired, as if the hotels were owned as of January 1, 2022, and exclude dispositions and assets held for sale since January 1, 2022. For the full year 2023, the Company anticipates its 2023 results will be in the following range:\n\n2023 Guidance(1) Low-End High-End Net income $165 Million $209 Million Comparable Hotels RevPAR Change 3.0% 7.0% Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin % 35.3% 36.9% Adjusted EBITDAre $420 Million $457 Million Capital expenditures $70 Million $80 Million\n\n_____________________ (1) Explanations of and reconciliations to net income guidance of Adjusted EBITDAre and Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA guidance are included below.\n\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call\n\nThe Company will host a quarterly conference call for investors and interested parties at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, February 22, 2023.

For more information, please visit www.applehospitalityreit.com.\n\nApple Hospitality REIT Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"); Modified FFO (\"MFFO\"); Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"); Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\"EBITDAre\"); Adjusted EBITDAre; and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss), cash flow from operations or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company’s results between periods and with other REITs. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income (loss) are provided in the following pages.\n\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of statements that include phrases such as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"goal,\" \"plan,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"outlook,\" \"strategy,\" and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\n\nCurrently, one of the most significant factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements continues to be the adverse effect of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants, on the Company’s business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows, the real estate market and the hospitality industry specifically, and the global economy and financial markets generally. The significance, extent and duration of the continued impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, including the extent and effectiveness of the actions taken to mitigate its impact, the acceptance and availability of vaccines, the duration of associated immunity and efficacy of the vaccines against variants of COVID-19, the potential for hotel closures/consolidations that may be mandated or advisable, whether based on increased COVID-19 cases, new variants or other factors, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. Moreover, investors are cautioned to interpret many of the risks identified under the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as being heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of COVID-19. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to effectively acquire and dispose of properties and redeploy proceeds; the anticipated timing and frequency of shareholder distributions; the ability of the Company to fund capital obligations; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate pending transactions and implement its operating strategy; changes in general political, economic and competitive conditions and specific market conditions (including the potential effects of inflation or a recessionary environment); reduced business and leisure travel due to travel-related health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic or an increase in COVID-19 cases or any other infectious or contagious diseases in the U.S. or abroad; adverse changes in the real estate and real estate capital markets; financing risks; changes in interest rates; litigation risks; regulatory proceedings or inquiries; and changes in laws or regulations or interpretations of current laws and regulations that impact the Company’s business, assets or classification as a REIT. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore there can be no assurance that such statements included in this press release will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. In addition, the Company’s qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to those discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Any forward-looking statement that the Company makes speaks only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\nFor additional information or to receive press releases by email, visit www.applehospitalityreit.com.\n\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n(in thousands, except share data) As of December 31, 2022 2021 Assets Investment in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization\r\nof $1,492,097 and $1,311,262, respectively $4,610,962 $4,677,185 Cash and cash equivalents 4,077 3,282 Restricted cash-furniture, fixtures and other escrows 39,435 36,667 Due from third party managers, net 43,331 40,052 Other assets, net 74,909 33,341 Total Assets $4,772,714 $4,790,527 Liabilities Debt, net $1,366,249 $1,438,758 Finance lease liabilities 112,006 111,776 Accounts payable and other liabilities 116,064",

      "content": "BOISE, Idaho, February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Boise Cascade Company (\"Boise Cascade,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" or \"our\") (NYSE: BCC) today reported fourth quarter net income of $117.4 million, or $2.95 per share, on sales of $1.6 billion. For the full year 2022, Boise Cascade reported net income of $857.7 million, or $21.56 per share, on sales of $8.4 billion. For 2021 comparative results, see the table below.\n\n\"As we close out 2022, I first want to recognize our associates for their tireless work, as they made our outstanding results possible. In addition to our financial results, we had strong performance in safety during a challenging period. I am also very pleased that we were able to take meaningful steps via acquisition and organic initiatives that will allow us to expand our EWP capacity and further grow our distribution capabilities,\" stated Nate Jorgensen, CEO. \"Our balance sheet remains well positioned for us to execute the growth initiatives started during 2022. In addition, we have the flexibility to further demonstrate our balanced approach to capital allocation, including the ability to pursue additional growth initiatives that align with our strategy. We recognize the industry will face challenges during 2023 given current economic uncertainties and weaker near-term demand for new residential construction; however, we remain committed to providing high service levels to our vendor and customer partners through industry cycles.\"\n\nFourth Quarter and Year End 2022 Highlights\n\n4Q 2022 4Q 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change (in thousands, except per-share data and percentages) Consolidated Results Sales $ 1,628,306 $ 1,782,183 (9)% $ 8,387,307 $ 7,926,111 6 % Net income 117,360 169,075 (31)% 857,658 712,486 20 % Net income per common share - diluted 2.95 4.26 (31)% 21.56 17.97 20 % Adjusted EBITDA 1 188,174 247,899 (24)% 1,257,564 1,052,470 19 % Segment Results Wood Products sales $ 425,602 $ 446,584 (5)% $ 2,115,896 $ 1,970,804 7 % Wood Products income 74,978 98,366 (24)% 575,167 531,235 8 % Wood Products EBITDA 1 99,708 112,227 (11)% 648,475 586,484 11 % Building Materials Distribution sales 1,443,780 1,645,513 (12)% 7,643,615 7,174,278 7 % Building Materials Distribution income 92,455 137,963 (33)% 627,091 481,085 30 % Building Materials Distribution EBITDA 1 99,396 144,221 (31)% 654,096 505,092 30 % 1 For reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, see summary notes at the end of this press release.\n\nIn fourth quarter 2022, total U.S. housing starts decreased 15%, driven by a decrease in single-family housing starts of 27% compared to the same period in 2021. For the full year 2022, total and single-family housing starts decreased 3% and 11%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2021. Single-family housing starts are the key demand driver for our sales.\n\nWood Products\n\nWood Products' sales, including sales to Building Materials Distribution (BMD), decreased $21.0 million, or 5%, to $425.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $446.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in sales was driven primarily by lower sales volumes for I-joists and LVL (collectively referred to as EWP). EWP volumes decreased due to a decline in housing starts and significant inventory destocking through the customer channel. These decreases were offset partially by higher EWP sales prices and higher plywood sales volumes. The increase in plywood sales volumes was due to our acquisition of Coastal Plywood and its plywood manufacturing operations on July 25, 2022 (the Acquisition). Wood Products' segment income decreased $23.4 million to $75.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $98.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in segment income was due primarily to lower EWP sales volumes and higher wood fiber costs and other manufacturing costs. In addition, the Acquisition was the primary driver of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense. These decreases in segment income were offset partially by higher EWP sales prices.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, sales, including sales to BMD, increased $145.1 million, or 7%, to $2,115.9 million from $1,970.8 million in 2021. The increase in sales was driven by higher EWP sales prices and higher plywood sales volumes. Plywood sales volumes increased due to the Acquisition. These increases were offset partially by lower plywood sales prices and EWP sales volumes. EWP volumes decreased due to a decline in housing starts and significant inventory destocking through the customer channel. Wood Products' segment income increased $44.0 million to $575.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $531.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in segment income was due primarily to higher EWP sales prices. This increase in segment income was offset partially by lower plywood sales prices, lower EWP sales volumes, and higher wood fiber costs and other manufacturing costs. In addition, the Acquisition was the primary driver of the increase in depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses during 2022.\n\nComparative average net selling prices and sales volume changes for EWP and plywood are as follows:\n\n4Q 2022 vs. 4Q 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Average Net Selling Prices LVL 32% 41% I-joists 40% 44% Plywood (1)% (14)% Sales Volumes LVL (30)% (3)% I-joists (55)% (21)% Plywood 29% 5%\n\nBuilding Materials Distribution\n\nBMD's sales decreased $201.7 million, or 12%, to $1,443.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $1,645.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Compared with the same quarter in the prior year, the overall decrease in sales was driven by a sales volume decrease of 14%, offset partially by sales price increases of 2%. By product line, commodity sales decreased 17%, general line product sales decreased 2%, and sales of EWP (substantially all of which are sourced through our Wood Products segment) decreased 19%. BMD segment income decreased $45.5 million to $92.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $138.0 million in the comparative prior year quarter. The decrease in segment income was driven primarily by a gross margin decrease of $39.7 million, resulting from decreased sales volumes and declining commodity prices during fourth quarter 2022. In addition, selling and distribution expenses increased $3.6 million.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, sales increased $469.3 million, or 7%, to $7,643.6 million from $7,174.3 million in 2021. The increase in sales was driven by sales price increases of 11%, offset partially by a sales volume decrease of 4%. By product line, commodity sales decreased 7%, general line product sales increased 17%, and sales of EWP increased 28%. BMD segment income increased $146.0 million to $627.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $481.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in segment income was driven by a gross margin increase of $215.5 million, primarily related to improved margins across our EWP and general line products. The improvement was offset partially by increased selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses of $56.8 million and $7.8 million, respectively.\n\nUnallocated Corporate Costs\n\nUnallocated corporate expenses increased $3.9 million to $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses, offset partially by lower self-insurance losses during 2022.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nBoise Cascade ended fourth quarter 2022 with $998.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $396.2 million of undrawn committed bank line availability, for total available liquidity of $1,394.5 million. The Company had $444.4 million of outstanding debt at December 31, 2022.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures in 2023 to total approximately $120 million to $140 million. Our 2023 capital expenditures range includes funding for greenfield distribution centers in South Carolina and Texas, which will allow us to better serve our customers in several high-growth markets, projects at our mills in the southeast to expand our EWP capacity, and the recently announced purchase of property to house an additional door shop assembly operation in Kansas City, Missouri. This level of capital expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of several factors, including acquisitions, efforts to further accelerate organic growth, exercise of lease purchase options, our financial results, future economic conditions, availability of engineering and construction resources, and timing and availability of equipment purchases.\n\nDividends\n\nOn February 7, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on our common stock, payable on March 15, 2023, to stockholders of record on February 22, 2023.\n\nFuture dividend declarations, including amount per share, record date and payment date, will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, legal capital requirements and surplus, our future operations and earnings, general financial condition, material cash requirements, restrictions imposed by our asset-based credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes, applicable laws, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\n\nOutlook\n\nDemand for the products we manufacture, as well as the products we purchase and distribute, is correlated with new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling activity and light commercial construction. While mortgage rates have declined from peak levels in late 2022 and home price increases have moderated, home affordability remains a challenge for consumers. The Federal Reserve's upcoming actions in response to inflationary data and what impacts these actions have on mortgage rates and the broader economy will continue to influence the near-term demand environment. We expect a deceleration in housing starts, with various industry forecasts for 2023 single- and multi-family housing starts in the U.S generally ranging from 1.1 million to 1.3 million units, compared with actual housing starts of 1.55 million in 2022 and 1.60 million in 2021, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. As it relates to home improvement spending, the age of U.S. housing stock and elevated levels of homeowner equity provide a favorable backdrop for repair-and-remodel spending. While likely tempered by an economic slowdown, we anticipate the primary drivers of repair-and-remodeling activity to continue to be supportive of homeowners' further investment in their residences.\n\nAs a manufacturer of certain commodity products, we have sales and profitability exposure to declines in commodity product prices and rising input costs. Our distribution business purchases and resells a broad mix of commodity products with periods of increasing prices providing the opportunity for higher sales and increased margins, while declining price environments expose us to declines in sales and profitability. We expect future commodity product pricing and commodity input costs to be volatile in response to economic uncertainties, industry operating rates, transportation constraints or disruptions, net import and export activity, inventory levels in various distribution channels, and seasonal demand patterns. In addition, we have experienced price erosion and reduced volumes on our EWP products due to slowing economic activity and decreased demand for new residential construction. As such, we have and will continue to manage our production levels to meet current and expected sales demand, which will result in operating some of our facilities below their capacity until demand improves.\n\nAbout Boise Cascade\n\nBoise Cascade Company is one of the largest producers of engineered wood products and plywood in North America and a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of building products. For more information, please visit the Company's website at www.bc.com.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call\n\nBoise Cascade will host a webcast and conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year earnings on Wednesday, February 22, 2023, at 11 a.m. Eastern.\n\nTo join the webcast, go to the Investor Relations section at www.bc.com and select the Event Calendar link. Analysts and investors who wish to ask questions during the Q&A session can register for the call here.\n\nThe archived webcast will be available in the Investor Relations section of Boise Cascade's website.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe refer to the terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this earnings release and the accompanying Quarterly Statistical Information as supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity that are not required by or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). We define EBITDA as income (loss) before interest (interest expense and interest income), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Additionally, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which further adjusts EBITDA to exclude the change in fair value of interest rate swaps.\n\nWe believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures because they present a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allow management to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons, and identify strategies to improve operating performance. We also believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because they provide a means to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and our Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our management and because they are frequently used by investors and other interested parties when comparing companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, however, are not measures of our liquidity or financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income (loss) or segment income (loss) have limitations as analytical tools, including: the inability to determine profitability; the exclusion of interest expense, interest income, and associated significant cash requirements; and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent unavoidable operating costs. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results. Our measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes statements about our expectations of future operational and financial performance that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our outlook. Statements preceded or followed by, or that otherwise include, the words \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"project,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"forecast,\" \"is likely to,\" and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as \"will,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" and \"could\" are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The accuracy of such statements is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected, including, but not limited to, prices for building products, changes in the competitive position of our products, commodity input costs, the effect of general economic conditions, our ability to efficiently and effectively integrate the Coastal Plywood acquisition, mortgage rates and availability, housing demand, housing vacancy rates, governmental regulations, unforeseen production disruptions, as well as natural disasters.

Under the two-class method, income from continuing operations is adjusted for dividends and undistributed earnings (losses) to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the weighted average diluted shares do not assume conversion of the preferred shares to common shares.\n\nEarnings guidance does not contemplate future items such as business development activities, strategic developments (such as restructurings, spin-offs or dispositions of assets or investments), contingent purchase price adjustments, significant expenses related to litigation and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting and tax matters). The timing and amounts of these items are highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a potential size that could have a substantial impact on the company's reported results for any given period. Prospective quantification of these items is generally not practicable. Forward-looking non-GAAP guidance excludes amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, as well as one-time charges, net of taxes. See reconciliations of the company's guidance included below.\n\nEarnings Conference Call Information KAR will be hosting an earnings conference call and webcast on Wednesday, February 22, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating adjusted net income (loss) and operating adjusted net income (loss) per share as presented herein are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these measures provide investors additional meaningful methods to evaluate certain aspects of the company's results period over period and for the other reasons set forth below.\n\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings as described in our senior secured credit agreement covenant calculations. Management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors. In addition, management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance.\n\nDepreciation expense for property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized internally developed software costs relate to ongoing capital expenditures; however, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, such as customer relationships, software, tradenames and noncompete agreements are not representative of ongoing capital expenditures, but have a continuing effect on our reported results. Non-GAAP financial measures of operating adjusted net income (loss) and operating adjusted net income (loss) per share, in the opinion of the company, provide comparability of the company's performance to other companies that may not have incurred these types of non-cash expenses or that report a similar measure. In addition, operating adjusted net income (loss) and operating adjusted net income (loss) per share may include adjustments for certain other charges.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating adjusted net income (loss) and operating adjusted net income (loss) per share have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations for the periods presented:\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, Year Ended\n\nDecember 31, (in millions), (unaudited) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income (loss) from continuing operations $        41.9 $        15.2 $        28.6 $        (0.8) Add back: Income taxes 17.9 (22.1) 10.0 15.1 Interest expense, net of interest income 34.9 31.7 116.5 124.8 Depreciation and amortization 24.0 28.2 100.2 109.9 EBITDA 118.7 53.0 255.3 249.0 Non-cash stock-based compensation (5.7) 1.3 17.5 14.3 Loss on extinguishment of debt 0.2 — 17.2 — Acquisition related costs 0.3 2.1 1.2 7.1 Securitization interest (25.8) (8.3) (70.7) (29.8) Gain on sale of property (33.9) — (33.9) — (Gain)/Loss on asset sales — 0.1 (0.1) (0.7) Severance 4.2 1.5 12.4 3.3 Foreign currency (gains)/losses (6.1) 1.1 2.5 3.8 Contingent consideration adjustment — 4.2 — 24.3 Net change in unrealized (gains) losses on investment securities 0.6 9.3 7.1 (1.4) Professional fees related to business improvement efforts 3.1 — 15.2 — Other 0.9 — 7.5 0.3 Total addbacks/(deductions) (62.2) 11.3 (24.1) 21.2 Adjusted EBITDA $        56.5 $        64.3 $      231.2 $      270.2\n\nThe following table reconciles operating adjusted net income (loss) and operating adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share to net income (loss) for the periods presented:\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, Year Ended\n\nDecember 31, (in millions, except per share amounts), (unaudited) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net income (loss) from continuing operations (1) $      41.9 $      15.2 $      28.6 $       (0.8) Acquired amortization expense 8.0 8.6 33.0 33.4 Loss on extinguishment of debt 0.2 — 17.2 — Contingent consideration adjustment — 4.2 — 24.3 Income taxes (2) (2.5) (2.1) (13.0) (8.2) Operating adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations $      47.6 $      25.9 $      65.8 $      48.7 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $       (4.8) $     (10.1) $     212.6 $      67.3 Acquired amortization expense — 4.4 5.9 21.2 Income taxes (2) — (1.1) (1.5) (5.2) Operating adjusted net income (loss) from discontinued operations $       (4.8) $       (6.8) $     217.0 $      83.3 Operating adjusted net income $      42.8 $      19.1 $     282.8 $     132.0 Operating adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations per share - diluted $      0.33 $      0.17 $      0.43 $      0.31 Operating adjusted net income (loss) from discontinued operations per share - diluted (0.04) (0.05) 1.43 0.53 Operating adjusted net income per share - diluted $      0.29 $      0.12 $      1.86 $      0.84 Weighted average diluted shares - including assumed conversion of preferred shares 145.7 156.1 151.9 156.6\n\n(1) The Series A Preferred Stock dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities have not been included in the calculation of operating adjusted net income (loss) and operating adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share.

      "content": "ATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2023 / HAVERTYS (NYSE:HVT and HVT.A), today reported its operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nFourth quarter 2022 versus fourth quarter 2021:\n\nDiluted earnings per common share (\"EPS\") of $1.42 versus $1.35. Consolidated sales increased 5.5% to $280.6 million. Comparable store sales increased 5.8%. Gross profit margin of 57.0% versus 56.4%. Pre-tax income of $32.5 million versus $32.1 million.\n\nFY 2022 versus FY 2021:\n\nEPS of $5.24 versus $4.90. Consolidated sales increased 3.4% to a record $1,047.2 million. Comparable store sales for the year rose 3.4%. Gross profit margin of 57.7% versus 56.7%. Pre-tax income of $119.5 million versus $118.5 million.\n\nClarence H. Smith, chairman and CEO, said, \"We are pleased to report continued record-breaking quarterly sales and our second year of annual sales over a billion dollars. Our fourth quarter gross profit margins remained strong and for the year reached a new high of 57.7%. Inflation and rising interest rates impacted our operating costs for wages and benefits and third-party financing. Our pre-tax income of $32.5 million was the 11th consecutive quarter we have achieved our goal of double-digit operating income as a percentage of sales.\n\n\"In 2022, we returned $63.9 million of capital to our shareholders. We purchased $30.0 million in common shares, paid quarterly dividends of $17.8 million, and in December paid a special cash dividend of $16.1 million. We have paid an annual cash dividend since 1935 and increased our quarterly cash dividend payouts each year since 2008.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we face an uncertain consumer spending environment, and rising interest rates have impacted the housing industry, particularly new home sales, which have a high correlation with our business. Despite these headwinds, we remain cautiously optimistic that our store expansion plan supported by our improved online presence, high-quality merchandise, and helpful service will drive market share gains. We are planning for profitable long-term growth and have the financial strength, systems, and importantly the people to achieve our goals and deliver investor value.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Results\r\n(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)\n\nResults of Operations Q4 2022 Q4 2021 FY 2022 FY 2021 Sales $ 280.6 $ 265.9 $ 1,047.2 $ 1,012.8 Gross Profit 159.9 150.0 604.2 574.6 Gross profit as a of sales 57.0 56.4 57.7 56.7 SGA Variable 53.1 47.5 193.7 173.8 Fixed 75.4 70.5 292.6 282.5 Total 128.5 118.0 486.3 456.3 SGA as a of sales Variable 18.9 17.9 18.5 17.2 Fixed 26.9 26.5 27.9 27.9 Total 45.8 44.4 46.4 45.1 Pre-tax income 32.5 32.1 119.5 118.5 Pre-tax income as a of sales 11.6 12.1 11.4 11.7 Net income 23.7 24.3 89.4 90.8 Net income as a of sales 8.5 9.1 8.5 9.0 Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") $ 1.42 $ 1.35 $ 5.24 $ 4.90\n\nOther Financial and Operations Data FY 2022 FY 2021 EBITDA (in millions)(1) $ 134.8 $ 134.6 Sales per square foot $ 256 $ 232 Average ticket $ 3,171 $ 2,865\n\nLiquidity Measures Free Cash Flow FY 2022 FY 2021 Cash Returns to Shareholders FY 2022 FY 2021 Operating cash flow $ 51.0 $ 97.2 Share repurchases $ 30.0 $ 41.8 Dividends 17.8 17.4 Capital expenditures 28.4 34.1 Special dividends 16.1 35.0 Free cash flow $ 22.6 $ 63.1 Cash returns to shareholders $ 63.9 $ 94.2\n\n(1) See the reconciliation of the non-GAAP metrics at the end of the release.\n\nFourth Quarter ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Same Period of 2021\n\nTotal sales up 5.5%, comp-store sales up 5.8% for the quarter. Total written sales were down 6.2% and written comp-store sales declined 6.3% for the quarter. Gross profit margins increased 60 basis points to 57.0% in 2022 from 56.4% in 2021 due to pricing discipline and merchandise mix. SG&A expenses were 45.8% of sales versus 44.4% and increased $10.5 million. The primary drivers of this change are:\n\nincrease of $6.1 million in selling expenses due to increased compensation and third-party credit costs. increase in warehouse, transportation, and delivery costs of $1.9 million due to increased fuel and compensation costs partially offset by lower demurrage fees. Effective tax rate of 27.0% driven by higher state tax expense and the impact of favorable adjustments in the prior year quarter for tax credits.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 are $129.9 million. Generated $51.0 million in cash from operating activities primarily from solid earnings performance, offset by changes in working capital, primarily a $50.1 million reduction in customer deposits. Purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for $30.0 million and paid $17.9 million in quarterly cash dividends and $16.1 million in special cash dividends in December 2022. The Company has no funded debt.\n\nExpectations and Other\n\nWe expect gross profit margins for 2023 will be between 58.0% to 58.5%. Gross profit margins fluctuate quarter to quarter in relation to our promotional cadence. Our estimated gross profit margins are based on anticipated changes in product and freight costs and its impact on our LIFO reserve. Fixed and discretionary expenses within SG&A for the full year of 2023 are expected to be in the $292.0 to $295.0 million range. Variable SG&A expenses for the full year of 2023 are anticipated to be in the 19.5% to 19.7% range. Variable expense increases over 2022 are primarily inflationary driven and costs of third-party financing costs. Our effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be 25% excluding the impact from the vesting of stock-based awards, potential tax credits, and any new tax legislation. Planned capital expenditures are approximately $28.0 million in 2023. We expect retail square footage will increase 2.2% as we open five stores and close one during 2023.\n\nHAVERTY FURNITURE COMPANIES, INC.\r\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n\nThree Months Ended\r\nDecember 31, Year Ended\r\nDecember 31, (In thousands, except per share data - unaudited) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales $ 280,557 $ 265,940 $ 1,047,215 $ 1,012,799 Cost of goods sold 120,622 115,853 442,990 438,174 Gross profit 159,935 150,087 604,225 574,625 Expenses: Selling, general and administrative 128,482 117,952 486,298 456,267 Other (income) expense, net (131 ) 94 44 54 Total expenses 128,351 118,046 486,342 456,321 Income before interest and income taxes 31,584 32,041 117,883 118,304 Interest income, net 920 58 1,618 231 Income before income taxes 32,504 32,099 119,501 118,535 Income tax expense 8,766 7,793 30,143 27,732 Net income $ 23,738 $ 24,306 $ 89,358 $ 90,803 Basic earnings per share: Common Stock $ 1.48 $ 1.39 $ 5.43 $ 5.06 Class A Common Stock $ 1.40 $ 1.31 $ 5.17 $ 4.75 Diluted earnings per share: Common Stock $ 1.42 $ 1.35 $ 5.24 $ 4.90 Class A Common Stock $ 1.39 $ 1.33 $ 5.07 $ 4.69 Cash dividends per share: Common Stock $ 1.28 $ 2.25 $ 2.06 $ 2.97 Class A Common Stock $ 1.21 $ 2.13 $ 1.96 $ 2.79\n\nHAVERTY FURNITURE COMPANIES, INC.\r\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\n(In thousands - unaudited) December 31,\r\n2022 December 31,\r\n2021 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 123,126 $ 166,146 Restricted cash and cash equivalents 6,804 6,716 Inventories 118,333 112,031 Prepaid expenses 9,707 12,418 Other current assets 18,283 11,746 Total current assets 276,253 309,057 Property and equipment, net 137,475 126,099 Right-of-use lease assets 207,390 222,356 Deferred income taxes 15,502 16,375 Other assets 12,429 12,403 Total assets $ 649,049 $ 686,290 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 23,345 $ 31,235 Customer deposits 47,969 98,897 Accrued liabilities 48,676 46,664 Current lease liabilities 34,442 33,581 Total current liabilities 154,432 210,377 Noncurrent lease liabilities 186,845 196,771 Other liabilities 18,373 23,172 Total liabilities 359,650 430,320 Stockholders' equity 289,399 255,970 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 649,049 $ 686,290\n\nHAVERTY FURNITURE COMPANIES, INC.\r\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n\n(In thousands - unaudited) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net income $ 89,358 $ 90,803 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 16,926 16,304 Stock-based compensation 7,195 8,213 Deferred income taxes 361 234 Net loss (gain) on sale of land, property, and equipment 128 (77 ) Other 960 869 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Inventories (6,303 ) (22,123 ) Customer deposits (50,928 ) 12,714 Other assets and liabilities (700 ) (3,244 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (5,982 ) (6,451 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 51,015 97,242 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Capital expenditures (28,411 ) (34,090 ) Proceeds from sale of land, property and equipment 86 88 Net cash used in investing activities (28,325 ) (34,002 ) Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Dividends paid (33,948 ) (52,446 ) Common stock repurchased (29,998 ) (41,809 ) Other (1,676 ) (2,894 ) Net cash used in financing activities (65,622 ) (97,149 ) Decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents during the period (42,932 ) (33,909 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents at beginning of period 172,862 206,771 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents at end of period $ 129,930 $ 172,862\n\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). We supplement the reporting of our financial information under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP information presented provides additional useful information but should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the related GAAP measures. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it affords investors a view of what we consider Havertys' earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such earnings performance.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP measures to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA\n\n(in thousands) FY 2022 FY 2021 Income before income taxes, as reported $ 119,501 $ 118,535 Interest income, net (1,618 ) (231 ) Depreciation 16,926 16,304 EBITDA $ 134,809 $ 134,608\n\nComparable Store Sales\n\nComparable-store or \"comp-store\" sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing stores and website by comparing the sales growth for stores and online for a particular month over the corresponding month in the prior year. Stores are considered non-comparable if they were not open during the corresponding month or if the selling square footage has been changed significantly. Stores closed due to COVID-19 were excluded from comp-store sales.\n\nCost of Goods Sold and SG&A Expense\n\nWe include substantially all our occupancy and home delivery costs in SG&A expense as well as a portion of our warehousing expenses. Accordingly, our gross profit may not be comparable to those entities that include these costs in cost of goods sold.\n\nWe classify our SG&A expenses as either variable or fixed and discretionary. Our variable expenses are comprised of selling and delivery costs. Selling expenses are primarily compensation and related benefits for our commission-based sales associates, the discount we pay for third party financing of customer sales and transaction fees for credit card usage. We do not outsource delivery, so these costs include personnel, fuel, and other expenses related to this function. Fixed and discretionary expenses are comprised of rent, depreciation and amortization and other occupancy costs for stores, warehouses and offices, and all advertising and administrative costs.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe company invites interested parties to listen to the live audiocast of the conference call on February 22, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. ET at its website under the investor relations section. If you cannot listen live, a replay will be available on the day of the conference call at the website at approximately 1:00 p.m. ET.\n\nAbout Havertys\n\nHavertys (NYSE:HVT and HVT.A), established in 1885, is a full-service home furnishings retailer with 123 showrooms in 16 states in the Southern and Midwestern regions providing its customers with a wide selection of quality merchandise in middle to upper-middle price ranges.

      "content": "WASHINGTON, February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP), a leading provider of online real estate marketplaces, information and analytics in the property markets, announced today that revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.18 billion, an increase of 12% over revenue of $1.94 billion for the full year of 2021. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $573 million, an increase of 13% over revenue of $507 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $369 million, an increase of 26% compared to net income of $293 million for the full year of 2021. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $124 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, an increase of 34% compared to net income of $93 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $672 million for the full year and $182 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\"2022 was an outstanding year for CoStar Group,\" said Andy Florance, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of CoStar Group. \"We delivered 12% year over year revenue growth while setting a record for full year net new sales bookings of $305 million, an increase of 41% over 2021. Our two largest product platforms, CoStar and Apartments.com, delivered revenue growth of 15% and 16%, respectively, in the fourth quarter, while LoopNet revenue grew 12% to end the year. I believe our efforts to expand our sales team in 2022 are starting to pay off,\" continued Florance.\n\n\"I’m particularly pleased with the revenue growth acceleration in Apartments.com, which began the year with 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter and ended the year with 16% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter,\" stated Florance. \"Net new bookings for Apartments.com in the fourth quarter were the highest ever, increasing 177% compared to the same period in 2021. This performance is expected to return Apartments.com to 20% or higher revenue growth during 2023,\" continued Florance.\n\n\"We've made great progress on our residential strategy in 2022,\" stated Florance. \"Traffic to our Homes.com network has passed 20 million unique monthly visitors and has doubled in the last few months. Our new product received an incredible response from agents at the National Association of Realtors trade show recently, while our 'your listing, your lead' strategy is delivering hundreds of thousands of valuable consumer leads directly to listing agents. Given the strong momentum of Homes.com, we plan to increase our residential investments in the year ahead,\" continued Florance.\n\nYear 2021-2022 Quarterly Results - Unaudited (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2022 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Revenues $458 $480 $499 $507 $516 $536 $557 $573 Net income 74 61 64 93 89 83 72 124 Net income per share - diluted(1) 0.19 0.16 0.16 0.24 0.23 0.21 0.18 0.31 Weighted average outstanding shares - diluted(1) 394 394 394 395 394 394 396 406 EBITDA 136 133 123 173 158 140 129 155 Adjusted EBITDA 160 150 144 193 178 159 153 182 Non-GAAP net income 108 103 99 138 123 112 118 153 Non-GAAP net income per share - diluted(1) 0.27 0.26 0.25 0.35 0.31 0.28 0.30 0.38 __________________________ (1) Certain prior period amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in June 2021.\n\n2023 Outlook\n\nThe Company expects revenue in the range of $2.46 billion to $2.48 billion for the full year of 2023, representing growth of approximately 13% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. The Company expects revenue for the first quarter of 2023 in the range of $575 million to $580 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range.\n\nThe Company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $500 million to $520 million for the full year of 2023. For the first quarter of 2023, the Company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $111 million to $116 million.\n\nThe Company expects full year 2023 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $1.06 to $1.09 based on 408 million shares. For the first quarter of 2023, the Company expects non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $0.25 to $0.26 based on 407 million shares. These ranges include an estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 26% for the full year and the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe preceding forward-looking statements reflect CoStar Group’s expectations as of February 21, 2023, including forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis, based on current estimates, expectations, observations, and trends. Given the risk factors, rapidly evolving economic environment, and uncertainties and assumptions discussed in this release and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, actual results may differ materially. Other than in publicly available statements, the Company does not intend to update its forward-looking statements until its next quarterly results announcement.\n\nReconciliation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail below, along with definitions for those terms. A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, can be found within the tables included in this release.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nFor information regarding the purpose for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release and why management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, please refer to the Company’s latest periodic report.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income attributable to CoStar Group before interest (expense) income and other (expense) income, loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, and settlements and impairments incurred outside the Company’s normal course of business. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues for the period.\n\nNon-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure determined by adjusting GAAP net income attributable to CoStar Group for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, settlement and impairment costs incurred outside the Company's normal course of business and loss on debt extinguishment, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs, and then subtracting an assumed provision for income taxes. In 2023, the Company is assuming a 26% tax rate in order to approximate its statutory corporate tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items.\n\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents non-GAAP net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of GAAP net income per diluted share. For periods with GAAP net losses and non-GAAP net income, the weighted average outstanding shares used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share includes potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the calculation of GAAP net income per share as the effect was anti-dilutive.\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nNet new bookings is calculated based on the annualized amount of change in the Company's sales bookings resulting from new subscription-based contracts and changes to existing subscription-based contracts for the period reported. Information regarding net new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of the Company's revenues over time.\n\nEarnings Conference Call\n\nManagement will conduct a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and the Company’s outlook at 5:00 PM EST on Tuesday, February 21, 2023. A live audio webcast of the conference will be available in listen-only mode through the Investors section of the CoStar Group website: https://investors.costargroup.com. A replay of the webcast audio will also be available in the Investors section of our website for a period of time following the call.\n\nCoStar Group, Inc.

These non-GAAP results are provided to enhance the users' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. The Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors and by excluding certain expenses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors and management with an alternative method for assessing operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing primary operations and to provide a consistent basis for comparison between quarters. Further, these non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any results prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the reconciliation of actual results titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\" in the accompanying tables.\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information on a forward-looking basis, including the guidance contained in this release, provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding its anticipated results of operations. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of GAAP measures to corresponding forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the high variability and low visibility of most of the items that have been excluded from these non-GAAP measures. For example, non-cash stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company’s stock will trade in those future periods. In addition, the provision or benefit for income taxes is impacted by non-recurring income tax adjustments, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP exclusions. The effects of these reconciling items may be significant, as the items that are being excluded are difficult to predict.\n\nAbout The Hackett Group\n\nThe Hackett Group, Inc.

These non-GAAP results are provided to enhance the users' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. The Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors and by excluding certain expenses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors and management with an alternative method for assessing operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between quarters. Further, these non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods. In addition, since the Company has historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, it believes the continued inclusion of non-GAAP results provides consistency in its financial reporting. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. (2) Non-cash stock based compensation expense is accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The Company excludes non-cash stock based compensation expense and the related tax effects for the purposes of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability, which exclude non-cash stock based compensation expense, are widely used by investors. (3) The Company incurs cash and non-cash stock based compensation expense for acquisition related consideration that is recognized over time under GAAP. The Company believes excluding these amounts more consistently presents its ongoing results of operations because they are related to acquisitions and not due to normal operating activities. The acquisition-related non-cash stock based compensation expense is also accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. (4) The Company has incurred expense on amortization of intangible assets related to various acquisitions. The Company excludes the effect of the amortization of intangibles from our adjusted results in order to more consistently present its ongoing results of operations. (5) The adjustment for the income tax expense is based on the accounting treatment and income tax rate for the jurisdiction of each item. For the quarter end periods the impact of non-cash stock based compensation expense was $0.7 million and $0.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively and the impact of intangible amortization was $46 thousand in 2021. For the twelve month periods the impact of non-cash stock based compensation expense was $2.7 million and $2.5 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively; the impact of intangible amortization was $32 thousand and $201 thousand in 2022 and 2021, respectively and the impact on the restructuring charge was $172 thousand in 2022.\n\nThe Hackett Group, Inc.

(Nasdaq: EXAS), a leading provider of cancer screening and diagnostic tests, today announced that the company generated revenue of $553.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $2,084.3 million for the full year of 2022, both ended Dec. 31, 2022. (PRNewsfoto/Exact Sciences Corporation)\n\n\"With a strong finish in 2022 and a great start to 2023, Cologuard and Oncotype DX® are setting the tone for an impactful year ahead,\" said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. \"Our financial strength, scientific capabilities, and deep partnerships with health systems put Exact Sciences in a leading position to deliver innovative tests that help prevent cancer, detect it earlier, and guide treatment to more patients globally.\"\n\nFourth quarter 2022 financial results\n\nFor the three-month period ended Dec. 31, 2022, as compared to the same period of 2021 (where applicable):\n\nTotal revenue was $553.0 million, an increase of 17 percent, or 28 percent excluding COVID-19 testing Screening revenue was $403.5 million, an increase of 45 percent, or 42 percent excluding the PreventionGenetics acquisition Precision Oncology revenue was $143.4 million, a decrease of 4 percent, or an increase of 1 percent excluding the divested Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test and a $1.8 million foreign exchange impact COVID-19 testing revenue was $6.0 million, a decrease of 87 percent Gross margin including amortization of acquired intangible assets was 70 percent, and non-GAAP gross margin excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets was 73 percent Net loss was $127.7 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to a net loss of $220.6 million, or $1.28 per share EBITDA was $(75.0) million and adjusted EBITDA was $4.9 million Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $632.1 million at the end of the quarter\n\nStory continues\n\nScreening includes laboratory service revenue from Cologuard tests, PreventionGenetics, and immaterial revenue from Biomatrica and Oncoguard® Liver products. Precision Oncology includes laboratory service revenue from global Oncotype DX® products and therapy selection products.\n\n2023 revenue outlook\n\nThe company anticipates revenue of $2,265-$2,315 million during 2023, assuming:\n\nScreening revenue of $1,660-$1,690 million, Precision Oncology revenue of $600-$620 million, and COVID-19 testing revenue of $5 million\n\nNon-GAAP disclosure In addition to the company's financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the company provides non-GAAP measures that it determines to be useful in evaluating its operating performance. The company presents EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP gross profit, and normalized and constant currency growth rates in revenue. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA consist of net loss after adjustment for those items shown in the table below. The company defines non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets used in the calculation of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin pertain only to the amortization associated with developed technology acquired and recorded through purchase accounting transactions. The amortization of these intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Normalized and constant currency growth rates in revenue are calculated to adjust for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency. To exclude the impact of change in currency exchange rates from the prior period under comparison, the Company converts the current period non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue using the prior period exchange rate. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. The company uses this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental information purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets although such measures include the revenue associated with the acquisitions. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA excludes a number of expense items that are included in net loss. As a result, positive adjusted EBITDA may be achieved while a significant net loss persists. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, see below \"EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliations\" and \"Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliations.\" Information reconciling forward-looking non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nFourth quarter conference call & webcast Company management will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, February 21, 2023, at 5 p.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2022 results.

The webcast, conference call, and replay are open to all interested parties.\n\nAbout Cologuard The Cologuard test was approved by the FDA in August 2014, and results from Exact Sciences' prospective 90-site, point-in-time, 10,000-patient pivotal trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2014. The Cologuard test is included in the American Cancer Society's (2018) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2021) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). The Cologuard test is indicated to screen adults 45 years of age and older who are at average risk for colorectal cancer by detecting certain DNA markers and blood in the stool. Do not use the Cologuard test if you have had precancer, have inflammatory bowel disease and certain hereditary syndromes, or have a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. The Cologuard test is not a replacement for colonoscopy in high risk patients. The Cologuard test performance in adults ages 45-49 is estimated based on a large clinical study of patients 50 and older. The Cologuard test performance in repeat testing has not been evaluated.\n\nThe Cologuard test result should be interpreted with caution. A positive test result does not confirm the presence of cancer. Patients with a positive test result should be referred for colonoscopy. A negative test result does not confirm the absence of cancer. Patients with a negative test result should discuss with their doctor when they need to be tested again. Medicare and most major insurers cover the Cologuard test. For more information about the Cologuard test, visit cologuardtest.com. Rx only.\n\nAbout Exact Sciences' Precision Oncology portfolio Exact Sciences' Precision Oncology portfolio delivers actionable genomic insights to inform prognosis and cancer treatment after a diagnosis.

The Company no longer includes research and development charges from asset acquisitions as an adjustment to EBITDA. Included in EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2021, is a charge to research and development expense of $85.3 million from the Company acquiring a worldwide exclusive license to the proprietary Targeted Digital Sequencing (\"TARDIS\") technology from The Translational Genomics Research Institute (\"TGen\") in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company's acquisition of PFS Genomics, Inc. in the second quarter of 2021. The acquisitions were treated as asset acquisitions under U.S. GAAP and resulted in the full amounts being charged to research and development expense. (2) Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company made an update to its non-GAAP measures policy to include the Company's 401(k) match expense in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. The Company matches a portion of Exact Sciences employees' contributions annually in the form of the Company's common stock. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 has been updated accordingly for comparative purposes. (3) Represents acquisition and related integration costs incurred as a result of the Company's business combinations and asset acquisitions, a majority of which relates to our acquisition of Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. (\"Thrive\") for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. This includes severance and accelerated vesting from post-acquisition qualified termination events, legal and other professional services, and the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liabilities in connection with business combinations. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, this includes a loss of $0.8 million and a gain of $56.6 million, respectively, resulting from the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liabilities. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, this includes a gain of $4.6 million and a loss of $6.4 million, respectively, resulting from the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liabilities. (4) The Company took proactive measures to address the impact of inflation and market volatility, and also simplify the organizational structure and prioritize programs that will have the greatest impact on improving cancer care. This resulted in a reduction of the Company's workforce in the second and fourth quarters of 2022. The adjustment to EBITDA represents personnel expenses incurred as a result of these proactive measures, a majority of which includes severance and accelerated stock-based compensation expense. (5) Represents the loss on the sale of the intellectual property and know-how related to the Company's Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score® test to MDxHealth SA and related severance, accelerated stock-based compensation, legal, and other professional service fees related to the divestiture. (6) Represents impairment charges on the Company's long-lived assets. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded insignificant impairments to building leases at certain of its domestic locations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company also recorded impairment charges on an acquired developed technology intangible asset, a supply agreement intangible asset, and a building lease. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded an impairment on the supply agreement intangible asset recorded as part of the combination with Genomic Health. (7) The Company presented a settlement offer of approximately $10 million to the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") concerning the DOJ's investigation of Genomic Health's compliance with the Medicare Date of Service billing regulations, which was accrued for during the third quarter of 2021. This represents the Company's best estimate of the probable loss for this matter, but the recorded amount may be materially adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of this matter.\n\nEXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION Selected Unaudited Financial Information Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliations (Amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue $      552,995 $      473,812 $  2,084,279 $  1,767,087 Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) 147,152 119,058 574,394 458,757 Amortization of acquired intangible assets (1) 20,717 21,216 86,967 84,173 Gross profit $      385,126 $      333,538 $  1,422,918 $  1,224,157 Gross margin 70 % 70 % 68 % 69 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets (1) 20,717 21,216 86,967 84,173 Non-GAAP gross profit $      405,843 $      354,754 $  1,509,885 $  1,308,330 Non-GAAP gross margin 73 % 75 % 72 % 74 %\n\n______________________ (1) Includes only amortization of intangible assets identified as developed technology assets through purchase accounting transactions, which otherwise would have been allocated to cost of sales.\n\nInvestor Contact: Megan Jones\r\nExact Sciences Corp.\r\nmeganjones@exactsciences.com\r\n608-535-8815\n\nMedia Contact: Morry Smulevitz\r\nExact Sciences Corp.\r\nmsmulevitz@exactsciences.com\r\n608-345-8010 Cision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exact-sciences-announces-fourth-quarter-2022-results-301752229.html\n\nSOURCE Exact Sciences Corporation",

Excluding the impact of the 53rd week from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 0.7% compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency movements had a negative impact of $8.5 million on revenue for the quarter and revenue from SYNETIQ* was $11.9 million. Excluding the impact of these items and the 53rd week, organic revenue increased 0.1%, to $520.1 million primarily due to higher revenue per unit of 3.9%, partially offset by a decrease in volume of 3.7%.\r\n\r\nService revenues increased 0.3% to $436.9 million from $435.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to higher revenue per unit and incremental revenue from SYNETIQ*, partially offset by lower volume of vehicles sold. Vehicle and parts sales decreased 22.9% to $86.6 million from $112.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower revenue per unit and lower volume of vehicles sold, partially offset by incremental revenue from SYNETIQ*.\r\n\r\nU.S. revenues decreased by 1.2% to $437.6 million from $442.9 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, U.S. revenues increased 4.7% primarily due to higher revenue per unit, partially offset by lower volume. International revenues decreased by 18.3% to $85.9 million from $105.2 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, International revenues decreased 15.5% primarily due to lower revenue per unit, partially offset by incremental revenue from SYNETIQ* and higher volume.\n\nGross profit, which is defined as total consolidated revenues minus cost of services and vehicle and parts sales, and exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by 1.6% to $191.3 million from $188.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher revenue per unit, partially offset by higher costs for towing, occupancy and wages. Gross margin in the quarter increased by 210 basis points to 36.5% from 34.4% in the prior year. Purchased vehicle and parts mix had a favorable impact of approximately 110 basis points on the gross margin change.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased by 7.0% to $59.3 million from $55.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $49.7 million, an increase of 3.8% compared to Adjusted SG&A expenses of $47.9 million in the prior year period. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount.\n\nInterest expense was $15.0 million compared to $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on our floating rate debt in the current year period.\n\nOther income, net changed by $4.3 million mainly due to unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in the current year period.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 16.1% versus 23.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 benefited from favorable adjustments of $2.4 million relating to Foreign Derived Intangible Income and $3.0 million relating to state tax planning initiatives.\n\nNet income increased by 6.3% to $77.9 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to $73.3 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted net income excluding the impact of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased by 6.4% to $81.9 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to $77.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 0.6% to $141.3 million from $140.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted EBITDA includes unfavorable foreign currency movements of $0.7 million and contributions from SYNETIQ* of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding these items and the impact of the 53rd week, organic Adjusted EBITDA was $141.0 million, an increase of 9.0% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\n*Through SYNETIQ’s first year anniversary in October 2022.\n\nAdditional Highlights for the Year Ended January 1, 2023:\n\nConsolidated revenues increased 14.2% to $2,098.9 million from $1,837.4 million in fiscal year 2021. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021, consolidated revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 16.0% compared to fiscal 2021. Foreign currency movements had a negative impact of $17.9 million on revenue for the year. Revenue from our recent acquisitions of SYNETIQ* and Auto Exchange* was $137.4 million. Excluding the impact of these items and the 53rd week, organic revenue increased 9.3% to $1,979.4 million, consisting of higher revenue per unit of 11.0%, partially offset by lower volume of 1.4%.\r\n\r\nService revenues increased 9.7% to $1,686.4 million from $1,537.7 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher revenue per unit and incremental revenue from SYNETIQ* and Auto Exchange*. Vehicle and parts sales increased by 37.6% to $412.5 million, compared to $299.7 million in fiscal 2021, primarily due to incremental revenue from SYNETIQ* and higher revenue per unit and higher volume of vehicles sold.\r\n\r\nU.S. revenues increased by 8.8% to $1,700.8 million from $1,563.3 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, U.S. revenues increased 10.5% due to higher revenue per unit, partially offset by lower volume. International revenues increased by 45.2% to $398.1 million from $274.1 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, International revenues increased 47.1% primarily due to incremental revenue from SYNETIQ* and higher volume of vehicles sold, partially offset by lower revenue per unit.\n\nGross profit increased by 1.4% to $734.7 million from $724.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher revenue per unit, partially offset by a higher mix of lower margin purchased vehicle and parts sales, market dynamics in our International segment, and higher costs for towing, occupancy and wages. Gross margin decreased by 440 basis points to 35.0% from 39.4% in the prior year. Purchased vehicle and parts mix had an unfavorable impact of approximately 100 basis points on the gross margin change.\n\nSG&A expenses increased by 10.3% to $212.1 million from $192.3 million in the prior year period. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $193.6 million, an increase of 9.1% compared to $177.4 million in the prior year. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to incremental costs from SYNETIQ* and Auto Exchange*, higher headcount, and higher spending on information technology, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\n\nInterest expense was $51.0 million compared to $57.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease in interest expense was due to a $10.3 million loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher interest rates on our floating rate debt in the current year period.\n\nOther expense, net increased by $4.4 million mainly due to unrealized foreign currency transaction losses in the current year period.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 19.1% versus 24.1% in the prior year. The effective tax rate in the current year period benefited from favorable adjustments of $15.1 million relating to Foreign Derived Intangible Income and $3.0 million relating to state tax planning initiatives.\n\nNet income decreased by 0.7% to $292.4 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, compared to $294.4 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 decreased by 1.3% to $313.8 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared to $318.0 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by 1.2% to $540.6 million from $547.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA includes unfavorable foreign currency movements of $0.7 million and contributions from SYNETIQ* and Auto Exchange* of $11.2 million. Excluding these items and the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021, organic Adjusted EBITDA was $530.1 million, a decrease of 1.2% over the prior year.\n\n*Through Auto Exchange’s first year anniversary in June 2022 and SYNETIQ’s first year anniversary in October 2022.\n\nOther Financial Highlights as of January 1, 2023:\n\nGross Transaction Value (\"GTV\")1 of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2022 Net Debt: $960.8 million Leverage Ratio: 1.8x Fiscal year 2022 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: $399.3 million Fiscal year 2022 Free Cash Flow: $260.0 million Repurchased $27.2 million of stock during fiscal 2022; $338.8 million remaining on authorization Liquidity: $726.4 million Year-over-year vehicle inventory change: -10.6%\n\n(1) Gross Transaction Value represents total proceeds from all items sold at the Company’s auctions.\n\nPlease refer to the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of Net Debt, Leverage Ratio and Free Cash Flow to U.S. GAAP.\n\nManagement Remarks\n\nIn light of the transaction with Ritchie Bros.

These measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information\" below.\n\nEach of the non-GAAP measures disclosed in this press release should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses these financial measures and key performance indicators to assess the Company’s financial operating performance, and we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the Company’s results, as noted below.\n\nOrganic revenue growth is growth in GAAP revenue adjusted to exclude (a) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, and (b) the impact of foreign currency movements and adjusted to exclude the additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as a result of the Company’s 52/53 week fiscal year. We believe that this measure helps investors analyze revenue on a comparable basis versus the prior year.\n\nAdjusted SG&A expense is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as GAAP SG&A expenses further adjusted for items that management believes are not representative of ongoing operations, including, but not limited to, (a) non-income, tax-related accruals, (b) fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration, (c) severance, restructuring and other retention expenses, (d) certain professional fees and (e) acquisition costs. We believe this measure helps investors understand the Company’s ongoing cost and expense structure and compare it to prior and future periods.\n\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures calculated as net income further adjusted for items that management believes are not representative of ongoing operations including, but not limited to, (a) loss on extinguishment of debt, (b) non-income, tax-related accruals, (c) fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration, (d) severance, restructuring and other retention expenses, (e) the net loss or gain on the sale of assets or expenses associated with certain M&A, financing and other transactions, (f) acquisition costs, and (g) certain professional fees, as well as (h) gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange rates, and (i) the amortization of acquired intangible assets, and further adjusted to reflect the tax impact of these items. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are also adjusted to exclude the additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as a result of the Company’s 52/53 week fiscal year. We believe that these measures help investors understand the long-term profitability of our Company and compare our profitability to prior and future periods.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net income before income taxes, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and further adjusted for items that management believes are not representative of ongoing operations including, but not limited to, (a) non-income, tax-related accruals, (b) fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration (c) severance, restructuring and other retention expenses, (d) the net loss or gain on the sale of assets or expenses associated with certain M&A, financing and other transactions, (e) acquisition costs, and (f) certain professional fees, as well as (g) gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange rates. Organic Adjusted EBITDA is further adjusted to exclude (a) EBITDA from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition (b) the impact of foreign currency movements and (c) the additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as a result of the Company’s 52/53 week fiscal year. We believe that these measures provide useful information regarding our operational performance because they enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our core financial performance and help investors compare our performance to prior and future periods.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, equipment and computer software, and plus proceeds from the sale of equipment. We believe that this measure helps investors understand our ability to generate cash without external financings, invest in our business, grow our business through acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. A limitation of free cash flow is that is does not consider the Company’s debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures. As a result, free cash flow is not necessarily representative of cash available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nLeverage ratio is a non-GAAP measure defined as Net Debt divided by LTM Adjusted EBITDA. Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash. LTM Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA over the prior twelve month period. We believe these measures help investors understand our capital structure and level of debt compared to prior and future periods.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nIAA, Inc.

With our near record $2.7 billion backlog, continued executional improvement and planned cost initiatives to address inflationary pressures, we fully expect our results in 2023 will generate significant long-term value for all stakeholders.\"\n\n2023 Guidance3 Flowserve reaffirms its Reported and Adjusted EPS guidance for 2023, which was initiated on February 10, 2023, as well as certain other financial metrics, as shown in the table below.\n\n2023 Target Range Revenue Growth Up 9.0% to 11.0% Reported Earnings Per Share $1.40 - $1.65 Adjusted Earnings Per Share $1.50 - $1.75 Net Interest Expense $55 - $60 million Adjusted Tax Rate 18% - 20% Capital Expenditures $75 - $85 million\n\nThis outlook excludes any contribution from the expected acquisition of Velan Inc., announced previously.

The call can be accessed by shareholders and other interested parties at www.flowserve.com under the \"Investor Relations\" section.\n\n1 See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures table for detailed reconciliation of reported results to adjusted measures. 2 Adjusted gross and operating margins are calculated by dividing adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income, respectively, by revenues. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income are derived by excluding the adjusted items. See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures table for detailed reconciliation. 3 Adjusted 2023 EPS excludes realignment expenses, the impact from other specific discrete items and below-the-line foreign currency effects and utilizes year-end 2022 FX rates and approximately 131.5 million fully diluted shares. _ FX impact is calculated by comparing the difference between the actual average FX rates of 2022 and the year-end 2022 spot rates both as applied to our 2023 expectations, divided by the number of shares expected for 2023.\n\nAbout Flowserve Flowserve Corp. is one of the world’s leading providers of fluid motion and control products and services.

Words or phrases such as, \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"believes,\" \"forecasts,\" \"predicts\" or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which include, without limitation, earnings forecasts, statements relating to our business strategy and statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies and anticipated developments concerning our industry, business, operations and financial performance and condition.\n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on our current expectations, projections, estimates and assumptions. These statements are only predictions, not guarantees. Such forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from what is forecast in such forward-looking statements, and include, without limitation, the following: the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 on our business and operations; a portion of our bookings may not lead to completed sales, and our ability to convert bookings into revenues at acceptable profit margins; changes in global economic conditions and the potential for unexpected cancellations or delays of customer orders in our reported backlog; our dependence on our customers’ ability to make required capital investment and maintenance expenditures; if we are not able to successfully execute and realize the expected financial benefits from our strategic transformation and realignment initiatives or integrate and realize the synergies of any acquisition, our business could be adversely affected; risks associated with cost overruns on fixed-fee projects and in taking customer orders for large complex custom engineered products; the substantial dependence of our sales on the success of the oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management industries; the adverse impact of volatile raw materials prices on our products and operating margins; economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations, including military actions, trade embargoes, epidemics or pandemics or changes to tariffs or trade agreements that could affect customer markets, particularly North African, Russian and Middle Eastern markets and global oil and gas producers, and non-compliance with U.S. export/re-export control, foreign corrupt practice laws, economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; increased aging and slower collection of receivables, particularly in Latin America and other emerging markets; our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including in hyperinflationary countries such as Venezuela and Argentina; our furnishing of products and services to nuclear power plant facilities and other critical processes; potential adverse consequences resulting from litigation to which we are a party, such as litigation involving asbestos-containing material claims; expectations regarding acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses; our relative geographical profitability and its impact on our utilization of deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits; the potential adverse impact of an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; our dependence upon third-party suppliers whose failure to perform timely could adversely affect our business operations; the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; potential work stoppages and other labor matters; access to public and private sources of debt financing; our inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S., as well as in foreign countries; obligations under our defined benefit pension plans; our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud; the recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results; our information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, which could disrupt our business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information; ineffective internal controls could impact the accuracy and timely reporting of our business and financial results; and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAll forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain non-recurring items present additional useful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods, providing investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Throughout our materials we refer to non-GAAP measures as \"Adjusted.\" Non-GAAP financial measures, which may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31,  (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Sales $ 1,038,959 $ 919,456 Cost of sales (743,718 ) (652,362 ) Gross profit 295,241 267,094 Selling, general and administrative expense (193,588 ) (187,111 ) Net earnings from affiliates 3,647 5,147 Operating income 105,300 85,130 Interest expense (12,909 ) (11,770 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt - (38,003 ) Interest income 1,025 871 Other expense, net (28,711 ) (15,425 ) Earnings before income taxes 64,705 20,803 (Provision for) benefit from income taxes 60,257 (1,335 ) Net earnings, including noncontrolling interests 124,962 19,468 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (3,633 ) (2,738 ) Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 121,329 $ 16,730 Net earnings per share attributable to Flowserve Corporation common shareholders: Basic 0.93 0.13 Diluted 0.92 0.13 Weighted average shares - basic 130,710 130,245 Weighted average shares - diluted 131,560 130,829\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES (Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) As Reported (a) Realignment (1) Other Items As Adjusted Sales $ 1,038,959 $ - $ - $ 1,038,959 Gross profit 295,241 (481 ) (3,646 ) (3) 299,368 Gross margin 28.4 % - - 28.8 % Selling, general and administrative expense (193,588 ) 480 (2,885 ) (4) (191,183 ) Net earnings from affiliates 3,647 - - 3,647 Operating income 105,300 (1 ) (6,531 ) 111,832 Operating income as a percentage of sales 10.1 % - - 10.8 % Interest and other expense, net (40,595 ) - (25,206 ) (5) (15,389 ) Earnings before income taxes 64,705 (1 ) (31,737 ) 96,443 (Provision for) benefit from income taxes 60,257 1,866 (2) 68,144 (6) (9,753 ) Tax Rate -93.1 % 186600.0 % 214.7 % 10.1 % Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 121,329 $ 1,865 $ 36,407 $ 83,057 Net earnings per share attributable to Flowserve Corporation common shareholders: Basic $ 0.93 $ 0.01 $ 0.28 $ 0.64 Diluted 0.92 0.01 0.28 0.63 Basic number of shares used for calculation 130,710 130,710 130,710 130,710 Diluted number of shares used for calculation 131,560 131,560 131,560 131,560 (a) Reported in conformity with U.S. GAAP Notes: (1) Represents realignment adjustments incurred as a result of realignment programs (2) Includes tax impact of items above and reversal of realignment exit tax ($2.1 million) (3) Represents incremental reserve of Russia related financial exposures ($8.1 million) and reversals of expenses that were adjusted for Non-GAAP measures in previous periods ($4.5 million) (4) Represents incremental reserve of Russia related financial exposures ($5.5 million) and reversals of expenses that were adjusted for Non-GAAP measures in previous periods ($2.6 million) (5) Represents below-the-line foreign exchange impacts (6) Includes tax impact of items above and tax benefit due to the release of tax valuation allowance ($59.3 million)\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES (Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) As Reported (a) Realignment (1) Other Items As Adjusted Sales $ 919,456 $ - $ - $ 919,456 Gross profit 267,094 (1,031 ) - 268,125 Gross margin 29.0 % - - 29.2 % Selling, general and administrative expense (187,111 ) 808 - (187,919 ) Gain on sale of business - - - - Net earnings from affiliates 5,147 - - 5,147 Operating income 85,130 (223 ) - 85,353 Operating income as a percentage of sales 9.3 % - - 9.3 % Interest and other expense, net (64,327 ) - (51,355 ) (3) (12,972 ) Earnings before income taxes 20,803 (223 ) (51,355 ) 72,381 (Provision for) benefit from income taxes (1,335 ) (1,396 ) (2) 10,788 (4) (10,727 ) Tax Rate 6.4 % -626.0 % 21.0 % 14.8 % Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 16,730 $ (1,619 )  $ (40,567 )  $ 58,916 Net earnings per share attributable to Flowserve Corporation common shareholders: Basic $ 0.13 $ (0.01 ) $ (0.31",

      "title": "UFP Industries Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 Results",
      "content": "Full year net sales increase 11 percent and earnings per share increase 28 percent\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich., February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UFP Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: UFPI) today announced net sales of $1.9 billion, net earnings attributable to controlling interest of $133 million, and earnings per diluted share of $2.10 for the fourth quarter of 2022. The company also announced a record $9.6 billion in net sales for fiscal 2022, an 11 percent increase over 2021, and record 2022 earnings per diluted share of $10.97, a 28 percent increase over the previous year.\n\n\"As we celebrate record results for 2022, we also turn toward a cooling housing market and softening economy with determination and conviction,\" said Chairman and CEO Matthew J. Missad. \"Importantly, our strong balance sheet enables us to remain on offense during periods of economic uncertainty and invest in new product innovation and in markets with significant long-term value potential. Our balanced business model continues to prove its advantage by giving us the flexibility to adjust to market fluctuations and allocate resources where we see the greatest return across our diverse and complementary markets. We see opportunities in challenging times, and, as in the past, we plan to take advantage of them in 2023.\n\n\"To recognize the hard work of our teammates in 2022, we provided significant wage increases and will pay our production and hourly employees more than $60 million in bonuses and other extra compensation.\"\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Highlights (comparisons on a year-over-year basis):\n\nNet sales of $1.91 billion decreased 5 percent due to a 10 percent decrease in organic unit sales, a 4 percent increase in prices, and a 1 percent increase from acquisitions. New product sales of $164 million increased 36 percent. Earnings from operations of $169 million decreased 14 percent. Adjusted EBITDA of $213 million decreased 5 percent from the record performance during the same period of 2021, while adjusted EBITDA margin remained unchanged at 11.1 percent.\n\nStory continues\n\nFiscal 2022 Highlights (comparisons on a year-over-year basis):\n\nNet sales of $9.63 billion increased 11 percent due a 3 percent increase from acquisitions, a 9 percent increase in prices, and a 1 percent decline in organic unit sales. New product sales were $736 million, up 53 percent. Earnings from operations of $950 million increased 29 percent. Acquisitions contributed $16.5 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion increased 32 percent. Acquisitions contributed $25.5 million to adjusted EBITDA.\n\nCapital Allocation\n\nUFP Industries maintains a strong balance sheet with $281.3 million in net surplus cash (surplus cash less interest-bearing debt and cash overdraft) at year-end 2022, compared to $50.6 million in net debt at year-end 2021, and had more than $1.8 billion of liquidity at year-end 2022. The company’s return-focused approach to capital allocation included:\n\n- Investments of approximately $174 million for capital expenditures during 2022. The company is targeting $200-225 million in 2023, including value-added growth investments as well as significant investments in automation, robotics and technology.\n\n- Repurchases of approximately 1,247,000 shares of common stock for $95.8 million during 2022 (an average price of $76.83 per share). The company is authorized to purchase an additional 2 million shares through February 3, 2024, and will continue to repurchase UFPI shares when the price is advantageous to offset dilution resulting from long-term, share-based incentive compensation programs. In 2022, the company issued 919,000 shares for share-based compensation programs at an average issue price of $82.61 per share.\n\n- Paid dividends of $58.9 million or $0.95 per share in 2022, a 46 percent increase per share over 2021. On February 3, 2023, the Board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.25 per share, payable on March 15, 2023, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2023.\n\nThe company continues to seek strategic acquisitions that allow it to drive long-term growth and margin improvements, enhance its capabilities, and create incremental value for its customers and shareholders. During the fourth quarter of 2022, UFP Packaging acquired Titan Corrugated and its affiliate, All Boxed Up. For the full year 2022, UFP Industries made four acquisitions, including Cedar Poly, Ultra Aluminum Manufacturing, and a 50 percent stake in Dempsey Wood Products.\n\nBy business segment, the company reported the following 2022 results:\n\nUFP Retail Solutions\n\nFourth Quarter: $690.7 million in net sales, down 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2021 due to a 9 percent decline in organic unit sales and a 2 percent decline due to the transfer of certain building products to the construction segment, which was offset by a 7 percent increase in selling prices and a 2 percent increase from acquisitions.\n\nFull Year: $3.65 billion in net sales, up 7 percent from 2021 due to a 5 percent increase in unit sales from acquisitions and a 7 percent increase in selling prices, which was offset by a 3 percent decline in organic unit sales and a 2 percent decrease due to the transfer of certain products to the construction segment.\n\nSegment Outlook: After experiencing a significant increase in demand during the pandemic, we continue to expect more normalized demand in our retail solutions segment in 2023. We anticipate lumber prices will normalize and follow more seasonal historical trends in 2023, and the retail segment will experience flat unit sales.\n\nUFP Packaging (formerly UFP Industrial)\n\nFourth Quarter: $522.2 million in net sales, up 1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, due to a 1 percent increase in selling prices and flat organic unit sales growth.\n\nFull Year: $2.39 billion in net sales, up 11 percent from the previous year due to a 12 percent increase in selling prices, a 1 percent increase in unit sales from acquisitions, and a 2 percent decrease in organic unit sales.\n\nSegment Outlook: We continue to monitor business activity and the key economic indicators that drive this segment with many of those metrics indicating unit sales will be flat to slightly down in 2023.\n\nUFP Construction\n\nFourth Quarter: $604.9 million in net sales, down 11 percent over the fourth quarter of 2021, due to a 16 percent decline in organic unit sales, a 3 percent increase in selling prices, and a 2 percent increase from the transfer of certain products from the retail solutions segment.\n\nFull Year: $3.14 billion in net sales, up 17 percent from the previous year due to an 11 percent increase in selling prices, a 4 percent increase in organic unit sales, and a 2 percent increase due to the transfer of certain products from the retail solutions segment.\n\nSegment Outlook: The portion of the construction business which focuses on housing includes site-built residential (14 percent of total company sales in 2022) and factory built (12 percent). There are many estimates on housing starts, with the consensus estimating a 15-20 percent decline in 2023.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nUFP Industries will conduct a conference call to discuss information included in this news release and related matters at 4:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, February 21, 2023.

In particular, the non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense financial measures exclude non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, and the revenue and percentage changes in revenue growth at CER are presented excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For financial measures given at CER, the current period's foreign currency revenue values are converted into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates from the prior period. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a complement to financial measures reported in GAAP because management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing and identifying operational trends. In management's opinion, these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and other users of PTC's financial statements by providing greater transparency into the historical and projected operating performance of PTC and the company's future outlook. Non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Led by very strong momentum in the mid market & enterprise, successful monetization changes and a rapidly maturing market opportunity, we expect to deliver accelerating ARR growth in 2023. And we expect we’ll do it profitably on a non-GAAP basis.”\n\nFor the full year 2023, the Company currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue between $332 to $333 million, or growth of 31% year-over-year. Services revenue will be lower than 2022 levels. Total 2023 ARR growth will exceed total reported revenue growth by at least 200bps. Non-GAAP operating income between $1.6 and $2.0 million. This range implies at least 210bps of year-over-year Non-GAAP operating margin improvement. Non-GAAP net income per share of between $0.03 and $0.04 based on approximately 56.0 million weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding.\n\nThe Company’s first quarter and 2023 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the Company’s control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.\n\nThe Company does not provide guidance for operating loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP operating income, net loss per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP net income per share, or operating margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Non-GAAP operating margin, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income per share and Non-GAAP operating margin and these comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items. These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe financial results and business highlights will be discussed on a conference call and webcast scheduled at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) today, February 21, 2023. Online registration for this event conference call can be found at https://conferencingportals.com/event/WCLZyewU. The live webcast of the conference call can be accessed from Sprout Social’s investor relations website at http://investors.sproutsocial.com.\n\nFollowing completion of the events, a webcast replay will also be available at http://investors.sproutsocial.com for 12 months.\n\nAbout Sprout Social\r\nSprout Social is a global leader in social media management and analytics software.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “intend,” “long-term model,” “may,” “might” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q1 and 2023 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others: we may not be able to sustain our revenue and customer growth rate in the future; price increases may negatively impact demand for our products, customer acquisition and retention and reduce the total number of customers or customer additions; our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform, our API providers, or certain social media platforms; if we are unable to attract potential customers through unpaid channels, convert this traffic to free trials or convert free trials to paid subscriptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected; the effects and duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are unpredictable and may materially affect our customers and how we operate our business, and the duration and extent to which the pandemic continues to threaten our future results of operations; unstable market and economic conditions, such as recession risks, effects of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain issues, higher interest rates and geopolitical impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, could adversely impact our business and that of our existing and prospective customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products; any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively affect our business; and changing regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and harm our brand. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022, as supplemented by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, to filed with the SEC, as well as any other future reports that we file with the SEC. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in those reports as being heightened as a result of the current instability in market and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to Sprout Social at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Sprout Social assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense. We believe non-GAAP gross profit provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, which is often unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss). We define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as GAAP loss from operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense. We believe non-GAAP operating income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, which is often unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin. We defined non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss). We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, which is often unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as GAAP net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, basic and diluted, excluding stock-based compensation expense. We believe non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provides our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, as this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the effect of stock-based compensation, which is often unrelated to overall operating performance.\n\nFree cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less expenditures for property and equipment. Free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual obligations or represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. We believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash used in our core operations that, after expenditures for property and equipment, is not available for strategic initiatives.\n\nFree cash flow margin. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses are defined as sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, respectively, less stock-based compensation expense. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide our management and investors with insight into day-to-day operating expenses given that these measures eliminate the effect of stock-based compensation.\n\nCustomer Metrics\n\nAnnual recurring revenue (“ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last date of the specified period. We believe ARR is an indicator of the scale of our entire platform while mitigating fluctuations due to seasonality and contract term.\n\nNumber of customers. We define a customer as a unique account, multiple accounts containing a common non-personal email domain or multiple accounts governed by a single agreement. We believe that the number of customers using our platform is an indicator not only of our market penetration, but also of our potential for future growth as our customers often expand their adoption of our platform over time based on an increased awareness of the value of our platform and products.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $10,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $10,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $10,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base.\n\nNumber of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR. We define number of customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR as those on a paid subscription plan that had more than $50,000 in ARR as of a period end. We view the number of customers that contribute more than $50,000 in ARR as a measure of our ability to scale with our largest customers and attract more sophisticated organizations. We believe this represents potential for future growth, including expanding within our current customer base. Over time, our largest customers have constituted a greater share of our revenue.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate by dividing the ARR from our customers as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st in the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We use dollar-based net retention to evaluate the long-term value of our customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nDollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate excluding SMB customers by dividing the ARR from all customers excluding ARR from customers that we have identified or that self-identified as having less than 50 employees as of December 31st in the reported year by the ARR from those same customers as of December 31st of the previous year. This calculation is net of upsells, contraction, cancellation or expansion during the period but excludes ARR from new customers. We used dollar-based net retention excluding SMB customers to evaluate the long-term value of our larger customer relationships, because we believe this metric reflects our ability to retain and expand subscription revenue generated from our existing customers.\n\nAvailability of Information on Sprout Social’s Website and Social Media Profiles\n\nInvestors and others should note that Sprout Social routinely announces material information to investors and the marketplace using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and the Sprout Social Investors website.

The distribution is payable March 24, 2023 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2023.\n\n\"We had a very solid finish to 2022, producing record annual results on a number of metrics and positioning us well for 2023,\" commented Jeffrey A. Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The US market remains active, with our largest US customers expected to all stay relatively busy with additional network deployment in 2023. We believe domestic activity will remain solid through 2023 and perhaps beyond, given the size and scope of our customers’ 5G deployment plans and our belief that much 5G work remains to be done on our assets. International results were strong as well in the fourth quarter, and gross leasing demand is expected to remain solid internationally. Last year was a remarkable year in terms of portfolio growth and balance sheet management. We grew our portfolio materially by 15%, providing us with additional growth assets in several markets. We were still able to end the year with our balance sheet in great shape, below the low end of our target net debt/Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as we used AFFO to reduce floating-rate debt in a materially higher interest rate environment. All of these favorable results allowed us to increase AFFO per share by double-digit percentages in the fourth quarter and for the full 2022 fiscal year over comparable prior periods. We are extremely confident and excited about our future, so much so that we have just approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of approximately 20%. While a substantial increase, this dividend on an annual basis represents only approximately 27% of our AFFO in our 2023 Outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth and stock repurchases and/or additional floating-rate leverage reduction while interest rates remain higher. We believe we offer our shareholders very favorable prospects for additional value creation.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Results\n\nThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and comparisons to the prior year period.\n\n% Change excluding Q4 2022 Q4 2021 $ Change % Change FX (1) Consolidated ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Site leasing revenue $ 609.6 $ 539.4 $ 70.2 13.0% 12.6% Site development revenue 76.5 55.9 20.6 36.9% 36.9% Tower cash flow (1) 485.9 434.1 51.8 11.9% 11.5% Net income 102.6 48.9 53.7 109.8% 47.2% Earnings per share - diluted 0.94 0.44 0.50 113.6% 49.2% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 460.7 409.1 51.6 12.6% 12.2% AFFO (1) 340.7 310.8 29.9 9.6% 8.9% AFFO per share (1) 3.12 2.81 0.31 11.0% 10.3%\n\n(1) See the reconciliations and other disclosures under \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" later in this press release\n\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $686.1 million compared to $595.3 million in the prior year period, an increase of 15.3%.

The Outlook provided is based on a number of assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable at the time of this press release. Information regarding potential risks that could cause the actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is set forth below and in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Company’s full year 2023 Outlook assumes the acquisitions of only those communication sites under contract and anticipated to close at the time of this press release. The Company may spend additional capital in 2023 on acquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified or under contract, the impact of which is not reflected in the 2023 guidance. The Outlook also does not contemplate any additional repurchases of the Company’s stock or new debt financings during 2023, although the Company may ultimately spend capital to repurchase additional stock or issue new debt during the remainder of the year.\n\nThe Company’s Outlook assumes an average foreign currency exchange rate of 5.20 Brazilian Reais to 1.0 U.S. Dollar, 1.33 Canadian Dollars to 1.0 U.S. Dollar, 2,330 Tanzanian shillings to 1.0 U.S. Dollar, and 18.20 South African Rand to 1.0 U.S. Dollar for the full year 2023. When compared to 2022 actual foreign currency exchange rates, these 2023 foreign currency rate assumptions negatively impacted the 2023 full year Outlook by approximately $11.0 million for leasing revenue, $7.7 million for Tower Cash Flow, $6.7 million for Adjusted EBITDA, and $6.0 million for AFFO.\n\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Full Year 2023 Site leasing revenue (1) $ 2,469.0 to $ 2,489.0 Site development revenue $ 205.0 to $ 225.0 Total revenues $ 2,674.0 to $ 2,714.0 Tower Cash Flow (2) $ 1,971.0 to $ 1,991.0 Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 1,845.0 to $ 1,865.0 Net cash interest expense (3) $ 377.0 to $ 382.0 Non-discretionary cash capital expenditures (4) $ 53.0 to $ 63.0 AFFO (2) $ 1,366.0 to $ 1,406.0 AFFO per share (2) (5) $ 12.46 to $ 12.83 Discretionary cash capital expenditures (6) $ 283.0 to $ 303.0\n\n(1) The Company’s Outlook for site leasing revenue includes revenue associated with pass through reimbursable expenses. (2) See the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure presented below under \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" (3) Net cash interest expense is defined as interest expense less interest income. Net cash interest expense does not include amortization of deferred financing fees or non-cash interest expense. (4) Consists of tower maintenance and general corporate capital expenditures. (5) Outlook for AFFO per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s outlook for AFFO by an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 109.6 million. Outlook does not include the impact of any potential future repurchases of the Company’s stock during 2023. (6) Consists of new tower builds, tower augmentations, communication site acquisitions and ground lease purchases. Does not include expenditures for acquisitions of revenue producing assets not under contract at the date of this press release.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nSBA Communications Corporation will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 21, 2023 at 5:00 PM (EST) to discuss the quarterly results.

      "content": "ICL Unit Growth Up 33% Y/Y in Fiscal 2022\n\nSTAAR Reaffirms Outlook for Strong Trajectory of Growth in 2023\n\nLAKE FOREST, Calif., February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--STAAR Surgical Company (NASDAQ: STAA), a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of implantable lenses for the eye, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 30, 2022.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Overview\n\nNet Sales of $64.0 Million Up 9% and Constant Currency Net Sales of $67.9 Million Up 15% from Prior Year Quarter ICL Sales of $61.2 Million Up 15% and Constant Currency ICL Sales of $64.3 Million Up 21% from Prior Year Quarter ICL Units Up 20% from the Prior Year Quarter Gross Margin at 77.7% vs. 76.3% in the Prior Year Quarter Net Income of $0.12 per Share vs. $0.10 per Share in the Prior Year Quarter Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Available for Sale Ended the Quarter at $225.5 Million\n\nFiscal Year 2022 Overview\n\nNet Sales of $284.4 Million Up 23% and Constant Currency Net Sales of $297.3 Million Up 29% from Prior Year ICL Sales of $269.7 Million Up 27% and Constant Currency Net Sales of $280.0 Million Up 32% from Prior Year ICL Units Up 33% from the Prior Year Gross Margin at 78.5% of Sales from 77.5% of Sales in the Prior Year Full Year Net Income of $0.78 per Share vs. Prior Year Net Income of $0.50 per Share\n\n\"Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results continue STAAR’s multi-quarter track record of industry leading growth with fiscal 2022 global ICL sales up 27% and in constant currency up 32% and units up 33% year over year. These levels of ICL growth exceed the ambitious goals we previously announced for 2022. Moreover, our growth significantly outpaced the roughly flat growth for refractive industry procedures over the same period1,\" said Tom Frinzi, President and CEO of STAAR Surgical. \"For the fourth quarter ICL unit growth was up 20% year over year, including U.S. units up 109% and China units up 18%. In China, transient COVID-related headwinds that impacted our results in the fourth quarter are subsiding as we move through the first quarter of 2023. Our outlook for fiscal 2023 total ICL sales is approximately $340 million, which represents 26% year over year growth. STAAR will move forward in 2023 with purpose and increased investment to further accelerate consumer awareness, surgeon confidence and adoption of our EVO ICL family of lenses, all while continuing our industry leading position as a high growth and profitable ophthalmic medical device company.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n1 STAAR Market Share Refractive Procedures and ICL Trends proprietary model as of January 12, 2023 estimates 4,322,688 global refractive procedures in 2022 and 4,345,812 refractive procedures in 2021, a 0.53% decline Y/Y.\n\nFinancial Overview – Q4 2022\n\nNet sales were $64.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 9% compared to $59.0 million reported in the prior year quarter. Changes in currency, primarily the Japanese Yen as well as the Euro, negatively impacted reported net sales by $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The sales increase in the fourth quarter was driven by ICL sales and unit growth of 15% and 20%, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. Other Product sales decreased 52% compared to the prior year quarter. ICL sales were 96% of total net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nGross profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 77.7% compared to the prior year quarter of 76.3%. Factors impacting the favorability in gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022, as compared to the prior year quarter, include product and geographic mix, partially offset by increased period costs associated with manufacturing projects.\n\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $48.8 million compared to the prior year quarter of $37.6 million. General and administrative expenses were $14.8 million compared to the prior year quarter of $11.5 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increased compensation related expenses, facilities costs and outside services. Selling and marketing expenses were $24.2 million compared to the prior year quarter of $17.1 million. The increase in selling and marketing expenses is due to increased advertising and promotional activities, trade shows and sales meetings, travel expenses and compensation related expenses. Research and development expenses were $9.8 million compared to the prior year quarter of $9.1 million. The increase in research and development expenses is due to increased clinical trial expenses related to U.S. post-approval studies.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $5.9 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared with net income of $4.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. The year over year increase in net income is attributable to higher other income, gross profit and a lower provision for income taxes, offset by increased SG&A expenses. Adjusted Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $6.8 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared to $9.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the financial tables included with this release.\n\nFinancial Overview – Fiscal Year 2022\n\nNet sales were $284.4 million for fiscal year 2022, up 23% compared to $230.5 million reported in the prior year. The increase in Net sales was driven by ICL sales and unit growth of 27% and 33%, respectively. Other Products Sales decreased 16% compared to the prior year. ICL sales were 95% of total Net sales for fiscal 2022 and 92% of total Net sales for fiscal 2021. Changes in currency, primarily in the Japanese Yen as well as the Euro, negatively impacted reported total net sales by $12.9 million for fiscal year 2022.\n\nGross profit margin for fiscal year 2022 increased to 78.5% of total net sales compared to 77.5% of total net sales for fiscal year 2021. The increase in gross margin for the year is due to geographic sales mix and an increased mix of ICL sales which carry a higher margin, partially offset by increased period costs associated with the manufacturing expansion projects.\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were $179.6 million compared to $145.3 million in the prior year. The 24% increase in operating expense is primarily due to higher marketing, promotion and advertising, compensation-related expenses, tradeshows and sales meetings and facilities costs.\n\nNet income for fiscal year 2022 was $38.8 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared with net income of $24.5 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the prior year. The year over year increase in net income is due to higher gross profit and other income, primarily from changes in interest income and foreign currency transactions, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Adjusted Net Income for fiscal year 2022 was $60.0 million or $1.22 per diluted share, compared with an Adjusted Net Income of $42.9 million or $0.87 per diluted share for fiscal year 2021. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the financial tables included with this release.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments available for sale at December 30, 2022 totaled $225.5 million, compared to $199.7 million at end of the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company generated $35.7 million in cash from operations for fiscal year 2022 and invested $18.1 million in property and equipment.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, Tuesday, February 21 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern / 1:30 p.m. Pacific to discuss its financial results and operational progress. To access the conference call (Access Code 268065), please dial 844-200-6205 for domestic participants and 929-526-1599 for international participants. The live webcast can be accessed from the investor relations section of the STAAR website at www.staar.com.\n\nA taped replay of the conference call (Replay Code 120085) will be available beginning approximately one hour after the call’s conclusion for seven days. This replay can be accessed by dialing 866-813-9403 for domestic callers and 929-458-6194 for international callers. An archived webcast will also be available at www.staar.com.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release includes supplemental non-GAAP financial information, which STAAR believes investors will find helpful in understanding its operating performance. \"Adjusted Net Income\" excludes the following items that are included in \"Net Income\" as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"): gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, stock-based compensation expenses, and valuation allowance adjustments. Management believes that \"Adjusted Net Income\" is useful to investors in gauging the outcome of the key drivers of the business performance: the ability to increase sales revenue and our ability to increase profit margin by improving the mix of high value products while reducing the costs over which management has control.\n\nManagement has excluded gains and losses on foreign currency transactions because of the significant fluctuations that can result from period to period as a result of market driven factors. Stock-based compensation expenses consist of expenses for stock options and restricted stock under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718. Valuation allowance adjustments can occur from time to time based on forecasted changes in operating results until all net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized. In calculating Adjusted Net Income, STAAR excludes stock-based compensation expenses and valuation allowance adjustments because they are non-cash expenses and because of the considerable judgment involved in calculating their values. In addition, these expenses tend to be driven by fluctuations in the price of our stock and not by the same factors that generally affect our other business expenses.\n\nThe Company also uses Constant Currency as a Non-GAAP financial measure to exclude the effects of currency fluctuations on net sales. The Company conducts a significant part of its activities outside the U.S. It receives sales revenue and pays expenses principally in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and euros. The exchange rates between dollars and non-U.S. currencies can fluctuate greatly and can have a significant effect on the Company’s results when reported in U.S. dollars. In order to compare the Company's performance from period to period without the effect of currency, the Company will apply the same average exchange rate applicable in the prior period, or the \"constant currency\" rate to sales or expenses in the current period as well. Because changes in currency are outside of the control of the Company and its managers, management finds this non-GAAP measure useful in determining the long-term progress of its initiatives and determining whether its managers are achieving their performance goals. The Company believes that the non-GAAP constant-currency sales results measures provided in this press release are similarly useful to investors to give insight on long term trends in the Company's performance without the external effect of changes in relative currency values. The table provided in this press release shows sales results calculated in accordance with GAAP, the effect of currency, and the resulting non-GAAP measure expressed in constant currency.\n\nAbout STAAR Surgical\n\nSTAAR, which has been dedicated solely to ophthalmic surgery for over 40 years, designs, develops, manufactures and markets implantable lenses for the eye.

      "content": "This press release contains forward-looking information that is based upon assumptions and is subject to risks and uncertainties as indicated in the cautionary note contained within this press release.\n\nTORONTO, February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dream Unlimited Corp. (TSX: DRM) (\"Dream\", \"the Company\" or \"we\") today announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (\"fourth quarter\").\n\n\"Dream has been making progress growing our asset management business and our income property portfolio together adding to our recurring income,\" said Michael Cooper, Chief Responsible Officer. \"Our impact initiatives have also contributed to being awarded the Quayside development, which is closing in March. Arapahoe Basin had a very successful year and continued to contribute to our overall profit and value creation. Although there have been many challenges in 2022, Dream is beginning 2023 in very good shape and we are improving the quality of our business and its value.\"\n\nA summary of our consolidated results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is included in the table below.\n\nFor the three months ended\n\nDecember 31, For the year ended\n\nDecember 31, (in thousands of dollars, except per share and outstanding share amounts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue $ 167,692 $ 150,122 $ 343,768 $ 325,922 Net margin $ 43,729 $ 34,685 $ 79,135 $ 60,566 Net margin (%)(1) 26.1% 23.1% 23.0% 18.6% Earnings (loss) before income taxes $ (57,525) $ 95,349 $ 197,291 $ 125,875 Earnings (loss) for the period $ (51,211) $ 80,317 $ 164,445 $ 110,661 Basic earnings (loss) per share $ (1.20) $ 1.87 $ 3.86 $ 2.52 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (1.20) $ 1.81 $ 3.74 $ 2.46 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total assets $ 3,956,494 $ 3,488,674 Total liabilities $ 2,402,802 $ 2,066,461 Total equity $ 1,553,692 $ 1,422,213 Total issued and outstanding shares 42,587,702 42,836,031\n\nLoss before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $57.5 million, compared to earnings before taxes of $95.3 million in the prior year comparative period. The decrease is primarily due to a fair value loss on Dream Impact Trust's investment in the Virgin Hotels Las Vegas, lower fair value adjustments taken on our investment properties including those held within our equity accounted investments and a $1.9 million loss on Dream Impact Trust units held by other unitholders.\n\nEarnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $197.3 million, an increase of $71.4 million relative to the prior year, primarily due to a one-time gain on a land settlement, condominium occupancies at Canary Commons in the first half of 2022 and $80.4 million in fair value gains taken on Dream Impact Trust units held by other unitholders. This was partially offset by the aforementioned reasons and higher interest costs.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 the Company has available liquidity(2) of $285.7 million, in line with $275.6 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\nSubsequent to the fourth quarter, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to the annual dividend per Subordinate Voting Share and Class B Share from $0.40 per share to $0.50 per share, effective with the dividend payable to shareholders on March 31, 2023.\n\nHighlights: Recurring Income\n\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue and net operating income(1) derived from recurring income sources was $42.7 million and $14.3 million, respectively, compared to $35.9 million and $10.0 million in the comparative period. The increase in revenue is primarily due to our portfolio of multi-family rental properties in the GTA and Ottawa/Gatineau, and higher earnings at the Distillery District.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue and net operating income(1) from recurring income sources improved by $51.2 million and $23.2 million, respectively, due to the aforementioned factors in addition to a growing asset management base, and improved performance at our recreational properties including Arapahoe Basin, our ski hill in Colorado, and the Broadview Hotel and Gladstone House, our boutique hotels in Toronto.\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, we increased our interest in the Distillery District from 50% to 62.5% for total consideration of $27.0 million. The 395,000 sf Distillery District historical retail area is a significant driver of recurring income and is 88.9% occupied as of year-end.\n\nRevenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 includes $11.5 million and $47.7 million, respectively, in asset management fee revenue, compared to $13.9 million and $43.1 million, respectively, in the prior periods. The increase in the year is largely driven by the growth in asset management base from the addition of Dream Residential REIT to the Company’s asset management platform and development activity at Dream Industrial REIT, while quarter-to-date fluctuations are driven by the timing of acquisition activity.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, our portfolio of stabilized properties generated Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $47.9 million, an increase of $27.4 million over prior year, largely driven by the growth in our multi-family portfolio in the GTA and Western Canada. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio comprises 1,599 apartment units (at project level) and is 96.3% occupied.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, Arapahoe Basin had its strongest performance ever, generating Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $12.6 million, up from $10.7 million in 2021. Our new Lenawee Express lift, the first six-person chair at the ski hill, opened to the public on December 16, 2022 and has reduced ride time by more than 50% for our visitors. We also opened our revamped charcuterie restaurant, il Rifugio, and the German-themed Steilhang Hut in late December.\n\n2022 results include $5.6 million in equity accounted earnings on our 36% interest in Dream Office REIT, down from $62.1 million in the comparative period due to fair value losses on Dream Office REIT’s portfolio and a lower share of earnings on the REIT’s 9.7% interest in Dream Industrial REIT. In addition, 2022 earnings include $5.9 million in equity accounted earnings on our 12% interest in Dream Residential REIT from its operations since it launched on May 6, 2022.\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company acquired de facto control of Dream Office REIT through the ownership of 18,473,925 REIT and LP B units. Dream Office REIT cancelled 242,200 REIT units that increased the Company's ownership of the REIT to over 36%. The Company will account for the acquisition as a step acquisition and remeasure its existing equity interest in Dream Office REIT to fair value at the acquisition date.\n\nOn February 17, 2023, we announced the closing of the transaction pursuant to which a joint venture between GIC and Dream Industrial REIT acquired Summit Industrial Income REIT in an all-cash transaction valued at $5.9 billion, including the assumption of certain debt (\"the Summit transaction\"). A subsidiary of Dream will be the asset manager for the joint venture and Dream Industrial REIT will provide property management, accounting, construction management and leasing services to the joint venture at market rates. Dream and Dream Industrial REIT intend to continue employing the majority of Summit employees post-closing.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, assets under management(1) totalled $18 billion, up nearly $3 billion since year end, and included a combined 63% in the industrial and residential rental asset classes and 31% located outside of Canada. Fee earning assets under management(1) totalled $11 billion as of quarter end, up $2 billion since December 31, 2021. Upon closing of the Summit transaction, we added approximately $5.9 billion to assets under management and fee-earning assets under management.\n\nAcross the Dream group platform, which includes assets held through the Company, Dream Impact Trust, Dream Impact Fund, Dream Office REIT and Dream Residential REIT, we have over 8,200 apartment units and 13.7 million sf of gross leasable area (\"GLA\") in stabilized rental, retail and commercial properties, in addition to our recreational properties. Over the next four years, we expect to add an additional 3,050 units and 3.0 million sf of rental, retail and commercial GLA to our recurring income portfolio (at project level), including West Don Lands Blocks 8 and 3/4/7, Canary Block 10, three buildings at Zibi and LeBreton Library Flats.\n\nHighlights: Development\n\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2022, our development business generated revenue and net margin of $125.0 million and $32.6 million, respectively, up by $10.7 million and $5.9 million from the comparative period. Results for the quarter were driven by higher acre sales in Western Canada.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, we earned revenue and net margin of $175.8 million and $24.0 million, respectively, down from $209.2 million and $27.1 million in the comparative period. 2021 results included Phase 1 occupancies at Riverside Square with no comparable activity in 2022. This was partially offset by higher acre sales in Western Canada.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved 858 lot sales and 39 acre sales, primarily across our Brighton, Alpine Park and Meadows communities in Saskatoon, Calgary and Edmonton, respectively. As of February 21, 2023, we have secured commitments for 420 lots and 23 acres (including 11 raw acres) across our Western Canada communities that we expect to contribute to earnings in 2023.\n\nIn the second half of 2022, we launched sales for the first tower at Forma (\"Forma East\"), an 864-unit condominium project located in the heart of Toronto’s entertainment district. This iconic project designed by Canadian-born architect Frank Gehry has achieved firm sales of approximately $800 million or 71% of units released as of February 21, 2023.\n\nIncluded in our consolidated fourth quarter results is a fair value loss of $54.8 million relating to Dream Impact Trust’s investment in the Virgin Hotels Las Vegas. The loss was due to substantial new capital required which Dream Impact Trust declined to further invest, resulting in a reduction to the value of our ownership interest.\n\nAcross the Dream group platform, we have approximately 4.4 million sf of GLA in retail or commercial properties and 25,900 condominium or purpose-built rental units (at the project level) in our development pipeline. For further details on our development pipeline, refer to the \"Summary of Dream’s Assets & Holdings\" section of our MD&A.\n\nHighlights: Impact Investing\n\nIn 2022, the Dream group of companies released our Net Zero by 2035 Action Plan, available here. The Action Plan details Dream’s commitment, targets and milestones, investment and emissions boundaries, actionable delivery strategy, and oversight and transparency plans. With over $6 billion in net zero communities within our development pipeline, we believe our bold approach to mitigating climate change will create further investment opportunities and create shareholder value.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, both Dream Impact Trust and Dream Office REIT have achieved a five-star GRESB rating, placing both companies in the top 20% global benchmark. The strong ratings were attributed to strong performance in leadership, policies, reporting, targets and data monitoring and review. Annual participation in the GRESB assessment provides us with the opportunity for a third-party assessment of our progress on achieving our impact/ESG related goals across the Dream platform.\n\nIn 2022, the National Capital Commissions (\"NCC\") announced in partnership with Canada Housing Mortgage Corporation (\"CMHC\") that Dream was selected to develop the first phase of the Building LeBreton project in Ottawa, Ontario. In the fourth quarter, the city of Ottawa’s planning committee approved two towers at our LeBreton Library Flats site, granting us an exemption to the city’s 25 storey height limit. The 31 and 36 storey towers will deliver 608 rental units, including 250 units designated as affordable, and will be the largest net zero carbon residential community in Canada upon completion in 2026.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, Waterfront Toronto approved a project agreement for the development of a 12 acre site at the east end of downtown Toronto's waterfront to build Canada's largest all-electric, zero-carbon master-planned community. The community will comprise over 4,000 units, including over 800 affordable housing units and 3.5 acres of public space with a car-free green oasis from Parliament Street to Bonnycastle Street that will connect projects further west towards Jarvis Street.\n\nThrough the Dream Community Foundation, which is privately funded by the Cooper family, extensive programming has been introduced at Weston Common, our 841-unit multi-family rental community, where approximately 25% of the units are affordable. Programming offered in 2022 included over 2,000 meals provided as part of an ongoing breakfast club, language classes, community event sponsorship, back-to-school supply kits and the introduction of a scholarship program to assist with the post-secondary education. The Foundation will look to extend this programming beyond Weston Common in 2023.\n\nShare Capital & Return to Shareholders\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, 0.4 million Subordinate Voting Shares were purchased for cancellation by the Company at an average price of $39.53 under a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for total proceeds of $14.9 million (year ended December 31, 2021 - 2.4 million Subordinate Voting Shares at an average price of $25.29).\n\nDividends of $25.6 million and $38.3 million were declared and paid on our Subordinate Voting Shares and Class B Shares in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, inclusive of a special dividend of $0.50 per share paid in the fourth quarter (three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 - $4.3 million and $13.5 million, respectively).\n\nSelect financial operating metrics for Dream’s segments for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 are summarized in the table below.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands of dollars, except outstanding share amounts) Recurring income Development Corporate and other Total Revenue $ 42,705 $ 124,987 $ — $ 167,692 % of total revenue 25.5% 74.5% —% 100.0% Net margin $ 11,119 $ 32,610 $ — $ 43,729 Net margin (%)(1) 26.0% 26.1% n/a 26.1% For the year ended December 31, 2022 Revenue $ 167,985 $ 175,783 $ — $ 343,768 % of total revenue 48.9% 51.1% —% 100.0% Net margin $ 55,116 $ 24,019 $ — $ 79,135 Net margin (%)(1) 32.8% 13.7% n/a 23.0% As at December 31, 2022 Segment assets $ 2,258,140 $ 1,669,623 $ 28,731 $ 3,956,494 Segment liabilities 980,905 613,966 807,931 2,402,802 Segment shareholders' equity 1,277,235 1,055,657 (779,200) 1,553,692 Shareholders' equity per share(4) $ 29.99 $ 24.79 $ (18.30) $ 36.48\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands of dollars, except outstanding share amounts) Recurring income Development Corporate and other Total Revenue $ 35,883 $ 114,239 $ — $ 150,122 % of total revenue 23.9% 76.1% —% 100.0% Net margin $ 7,996 $ 26,689 $ — $ 34,685 Net margin (%)(1) 22.3% 23.4% n/a 23.1% For year ended December 31, 2021 Revenue $ 116,766 $ 209,156 $ — $ 325,922 % of total revenue 35.8% 64.2% —% 100.0% Net margin $ 33,502 $ 27,064 $ — $ 60,566 Net margin (%)(1) 28.7% 12.9% n/a 18.6% As at December 31, 2021 Segment assets $ 1,885,019 $ 1,575,453 $ 28,202 $ 3,488,674 Segment liabilities 739,363 558,870 768,228 2,066,461 Segment shareholders' equity 1,145,656 1,016,583 (740,026) 1,422,213 Shareholders' equity per share(4) $ 26.75 $ 23.73 $ (17.28) $ 33.20\n\nConference Call\n\nSenior management will host a conference call on February 21, 2023 at 5:00 pm (ET).

The financial statements and MD&A for the Company are available at www.dream.ca and on www.sedar.com.\n\nAbout Dream Unlimited Corp.\n\nDream is a leading developer of exceptional office and residential assets in Toronto, owns stabilized income generating assets in both Canada and the U.S., and has an established and successful asset management business, inclusive of over $23 billion of assets under management(1) across four Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") listed trusts, our private asset management business and numerous partnerships as of February 21, 2023. We also develop land and residential assets in Western Canada. Dream expects to generate more recurring income in the future as its urban development properties are completed and held for the long term. Dream has a proven track record for being innovative and for our ability to source, structure and execute on compelling investment opportunities. A comprehensive overview of our holdings is included in the \"Summary of Dream's Assets and Holdings\" section of our MD&A.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures and Other Disclosures\n\nIn addition to using financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS, we believe that important measures of operating performance include certain financial measures that are not defined under IFRS. Throughout this press release, there are references to certain non-GAAP measures and other specified financial measures including earnings before income taxes after adjusting for fair value on Dream Impact Trust units held by other unitholders, net operating income, adjusted EBITDA, Dream Impact Trust and consolidation and fair value adjustments, which management believes are relevant in assessing the economics of the business of Dream. These performance and other measures are not financial measures under IFRS, and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers. However, we believe that they are informative and provide further insight as supplementary measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flow, or our objectives and policies, as applicable. Certain additional disclosures such as the composition, usefulness and changes, as applicable, of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release have been incorporated by reference from the management’s discussion and analysis of Dream for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, dated February 21, 2023 (the \"MD&A for the fourth quarter of 2022\") and can be found under the section \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", subheadings \"Earnings before income taxes after adjusting for fair value on Dream Impact Trust units held by other unitholders\", \"Net operating income\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", and \"Dream Impact Trust & Consolidation and fair value adjustments\". The composition of supplementary financial measures included in this press release has been incorporated by reference from the MD&A for the fourth quarter of 2022 and can be found under the section \"Supplementary and Other Financial Measures\". The MD&A for the fourth quarter of 2022 is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under Dream’s profile and on Dream’s website at www.dream.ca under the Investors section.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" represents net income for the period adjusted for interest expense on debt; amortization and depreciation; share of earnings from equity accounted investments; and net current and deferred income tax expense (recovery). The most directly comparable financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net earnings. This non-IFRS measure is an important measure used by the Company in evaluating the performance of divisions within our recurring income segment.\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2022 Asset\n\nmanagement Stabilized\n\nproperties Arapahoe\n\nBasin Dream Impact\n\nTrust &\n\nconsolidation and\n\nfair value\n\nadjustments(1) Total recurring\n\nincome Revenue $ 11,540 $ 18,238 $ 8,801 $ 7,416 $ 45,995 Net margin (9,833) 7,789 (1,210) 4,353 1,099 Net earnings (loss) $ (26,602) $ 5,625 $ (1,353) $ 13,108 $ (9,222) Less: Interest expense (276) (6,569) (127) (2,413) (9,385) Less: Taxes — — — — — Less: Depreciation and amortization — (290) (1,059) — (1,349) Less: Share of earnings (losses) from equity accounted investments (28,600) 2,116 10 298 (26,176) Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,274 $ 10,368 $ (177) $ 15,223 $ 27,688\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2021 Asset\n\nmanagement Stabilized\n\nproperties Arapahoe\n\nBasin Dream Impact\n\nTrust &\n\nconsolidation and\n\nfair value\n\nadjustments(1) Total recurring\n\nincome Revenue $ 13,944 $ 12,620 $ 7,434 $ 1,885 $ 35,883 Net margin 4,789 5,261 (1,392) (662) 7,996 Net earnings (loss) $ 28,217 $ 19,779 $ 1,159 $ 26,173 $ 75,328 Less: Interest expense (87) (4,055) (24) (905) (5,071) Less: Taxes — — — — — Less: Depreciation and amortization — (521) (1,131) — (1,652) Less: Share of earnings (losses) from equity accounted investments 23,472 (337) (16) 1,213 24,332 Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,832 $ 24,692 $ 2,330 $ 25,865 $ 57,719\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 Asset\n\nmanagement Stabilized\n\nproperties Arapahoe\n\nBasin Dream Impact\n\nTrust &\n\nconsolidation and\n\nfair value\n\nadjustments(1) Total recurring\n\nincome Revenue $ 47,712 $ 63,337 $ 43,400 $ 16,826 $ 171,275 Net margin 5,894 26,101 7,604 5,497 45,096 Net earnings $ 26,497 $ 26,678 $ 9,428 $ 8,647 $ 71,250 Less: Interest expense (791) (20,622) (255) (6,177) (27,845) Less: Taxes — — — — — Less: Depreciation and amortization — (949) (4,071) — (5,020) Less: Share of earnings from equity accounted investments 9,891 380 1,129 1,288 12,688 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,397 $ 47,869 $ 12,625 $ 13,536 $ 91,427\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 Asset\n\nmanagement Stabilized\n\nproperties Arapahoe\n\nBasin Dream Impact\n\nTrust &\n\nconsolidation and\n\nfair value\n\nadjustments(1) Total recurring\n\nincome Revenue $ 43,121 $ 29,481 $ 33,380 $ 10,784 $ 116,766 Net margin 17,594 11,609 3,640 659 33,502 Net earnings (loss) $ 92,946 $ 17,054 $ 6,452 $ 20,671 $ 137,123 Less: Interest expense (135) (8,345) (120) (3,514) (12,114) Less: Taxes — — — — — Less: Depreciation and amortization — (1,068) (4,111) — (5,179) Less: Share of earnings (losses) from equity accounted investments 75,791 5,994 (46) 1,173 82,912 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,290 $ 20,473 $ 10,729 $ 23,012 $ 71,504 (1) For the Company's definition of the following non-GAAP measures: Dream Impact Trust and consolidation and fair value adjustments, refer to the definition below.\n\n\"Dream Impact Trust & Consolidation and fair value adjustments\" are two separate non-GAAP financial measures and represent certain IFRS adjustments required to reconcile Dream standalone and Dream Impact Trust results to the consolidated results as at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Management believes Dream Impact Trust & Consolidation and fair value adjustments provides investors useful information in order to agree to the Dream Impact Trust financial statements.\n\nConsolidation and fair value adjustments relate to business combination adjustments on acquisition of Dream Impact Trust on January 1, 2018 and related amortization, elimination of intercompany balances including the investment in Dream Impact Trust units, adjustments for co-owned projects, fair value adjustments to the Dream Impact Trust units held by other unitholders, and deferred income taxes.\n\n\"Earnings before income taxes after adjusting for fair value on Dream Impact Trust units held by other unitholders\" represents the Company's pre-tax earnings excluding the impact from the volatility of Dream Impact Trust's share price. The most directly comparable financial measure to earnings before income taxes after adjusting for fair value of Dream Impact trust units held by other unit holders is earnings before income taxes. Management believes Dream Impact Trust and consolidation and fair value adjustments provides investors useful information in order to review Dream results without the volatility of fair value changes in Dream Impact Trust's trading price.\n\nFor the three months ended\n\nDecember 31, For the year ended\n\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Earnings (loss) before income taxes $ (57,525) $ 95,349 $ 197,291 $ 125,875 Less: Adjustments related to Dream Impact Trust units (1,879) (3,782) 80,411 (25,019) Earnings (loss) before income taxes after adjusting for fair value on Dream Impact Trust units held by other unitholders $ (55,646) $ 99,131 $ 116,880 $ 150,894\n\n\"Net operating income\" represents revenue less direct operating costs and is equal to gross margin as per Note 26 of the consolidated financial statements. Net operating income excludes general, administrative and overhead expenses, and amortization, which are included in net margin per Note 37 of the consolidated financial statements. The most directly comparable financial measure to net operating revenue is net margin. This non-GAAP measure is an important measure used to assess the profitability of the Company’s recurring income segment. Net operating income for the recurring income segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is calculated as follows:\n\nFor the three months ended\n\nDecember 31, For the year ended\n\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue $ 42,705 $ 35,883 $ 167,985 $ 116,766 Less: Direct operating costs (28,362) (25,921) (104,411) (76,351) Less: Selling, marketing, depreciation and other indirect costs (3,224) (1,966) (8,458) (6,913) Net margin $ 11,119 $ 7,996 $ 55,116 $ 33,502 Add: Depreciation 1,349 1,026 5,020 3,527 Add: General and administrative expenses 1,875 940 3,438 3,386 Net operating income $ 14,343 $ 9,962 $ 63,574 $ 40,415\n\nSupplementary and Other Financial Measures\n\n\"Assets under management (\"AUM\")\" is the respective carrying value of gross assets managed by the Company on behalf of its clients, investors or partners under asset management agreements, development management agreements and/or management services agreements at 100% of the client's total assets. All other investments are reflected at the Company's proportionate share of the investment's total assets without duplication. Assets under management is a measure of success against the competition and consists of growth or decline due to asset appreciation, changes in fair market value, acquisitions and dispositions, operations gains and losses, and inflows and outflows of capital.\n\n\"Available liquidity\" represents Dream's standalone corporate cash and revolving debt facilities, including the operating line – Western Canada and margin loan, to cover the Company’s capital requirements including acquisitions. This financial measure is used by the Company to forecast and plan to hold adequate amounts of available liquidity to allow for the Company to settle obligations as they come due.\n\n\"Fee earning assets under management\" represents assets under management that are managed under contractual arrangements that entitle the Company to earn asset management revenue calculated as the total of: (i) 100% of the purchase price of client properties, assets and/or indirect investments subject to asset management agreements; (ii) 100% of the carrying value of gross assets of the underlying development project subject to development management agreements; and (iii) 100% of the carrying value of specific Dream Office REIT redevelopment properties subject to a development management addendum under the shared services agreement with Dream Office REIT, without duplication.\n\nForward-Looking Information\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our objectives and strategies to achieve those objectives; our beliefs, plans, estimates, projections and intentions, and similar statements concerning anticipated future events, future growth, expected net proceeds from sales or transactions, results of operations, performance, business prospects and opportunities, acquisitions or divestitures, tenant base, future maintenance and development plans and costs, capital investments, financing, the availability of financing sources, income taxes, vacancy and leasing assumptions, litigation and the real estate industry in general; as well as specific statements in respect of expectations regarding closing of our Quayside development; the improvement of the quality of our business and its value; our intention of continuing to employ the majority of Summit employees post-closing of the Summit transaction; our development plans and proposals for current and future projects, including the addition of 3,050 units and 3.0 million square feet of rental, retail and commercial GLA to our recurring income portfolio over the next four years in connection with the West Don Lands, Canary Block 10, Zibi and LeBreton projects, and projected sizes, density, GLA, timelines, units at completion and uses; the commitments for a certain number of lots and acres in Saskatchewan and Alberta and expectation that the latter will contribute to earnings; Dream’s and the Dream group platform’s development pipeline, including square footage of GLA in retail and commercial properties, and number of condominium and purpose-built rental units; expectations, commitments, targets, milestones, and other details regarding the Net Zero by 2035 Action Plan; our $6 billion net zero communities’ development pipeline; our belief that our approach to mitigating climate change will create investment opportunities and shareholder value; expectations regarding our sustainability targets, including in respect of the Dream platform, Dream LeBreton becoming Canada's largest net zero carbon residential community and reaching its affordability targets, our Quayside project becoming Canada’s largest all-electric, zero-carbon master-planned community, and other sustainability characteristics about our projects; the Dream Community Foundation’s commitments and activities; the expectation that recurring income generation will increase as urban development properties are completed and held for the long term; the expected growth of our asset management platform; and our overall financial performance, profitability and liquidity for future periods and years.

      "title": "Here's How Freshpet (FRPT) Looks Just Ahead of Q4 Earnings",
      "content": "Freshpet, Inc. FRPT is likely to register an increase in the top and the bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 27, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $151 million, indicating a rise of about 30.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at a loss of 8 cents, which is narrower than the year-earlier quarterly loss of 21 cents a share. The consensus mark has been stable over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThis pet food company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 88%, on average.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nFreshpet’s top line during the third quarter is likely to have gained from strong product offerings. To boost portfolio strength, the company has engaged in well-chalked innovations. It has been striving to expand fresh and natural ingredients-based pet food products. The company is also likely to have gained from improved distribution and retail availability, backed by enhanced production levels.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, management is optimistic about the company, backed by robust demand, significant capacity, state-of-the-art facility, logistics, quality and commodity cost management. All the aforesaid tailwinds coupled with pricing and distribution gains are likely to have aided results during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter is likely to have been impacted by a tough operating landscape including inflationary pressures. Any deleverage in the selling, general and administrative expenses might have been a drag. The company has been witnessing higher selling, general and administrative costs for a while now.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Freshpet this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nFreshpet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Freshpet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nFreshpet, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Freshpet, Inc. Quote\n\nFreshpet has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nStocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates\n\nHere are three companies, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle:\r\n\r\nThe J. M. Smucker Co. SJM has an Earnings ESP of +1.94% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at $2.14, calling for an 8.2% decline from the year-ago period figure. SJM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.5%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for The J. M. Smucker’s top line is pegged at $2.2 billion, suggesting growth of 7.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nDollar Tree DLTR currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.97% and a Zacks Rank of 3. DLTR is likely to register top-line growth from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $7.61 billion, suggesting 7.5% growth from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dollar Tree’s earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $2.02 per share, suggesting 0.5% growth from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.

      "content": "Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 23.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.86 billion, suggesting growth of 29.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings stands at $20.97 per share, indicating growth of 32.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company’s earnings beat estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 731.39%.\n\nBooking Holdings Inc.

Quote\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nBooking Holdings’ fourth-quarter performance is expected to have continued to benefit from a substantial improvement in its booking trends, owing to increasing travel demand.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum in rental cars, and increasing airline ticket units and booked room nights are likely to have benefited the company in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nBKNG’s solid momentum across its agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is likely to have contributed well in the to be reported quarter.\r\n\r\nBKNG’s continuous efforts to provide benefits to travelers and supply partners are expected to have helped it gain momentum among its target groups, which, in turn, is likely to have bolstered its accommodation business in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nGrowing initiatives to strengthen the Booking.com brand and the Genius loyalty program are likely to have been positives.\r\n\r\nRising investments in the Mobile app to increase customer engagement are likely to have continued contributing significantly to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe impacts of continuous efforts to make Booking.com attractive, and the trusted payment intermediary among travelers and supplier partners are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.\r\n\r\nHowever, uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic are likely to have been concerning in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nMacroeconomic headwinds and stiff competition in the online travel booking space are expected to have acted as overhangs for Booking Holdings in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Booking Holdings this time around.

      "content": "Armstrong World Industries, Inc. AWI reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2022, wherein the earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined on a year-over-year basis. On the contrary, net sales beat the consensus estimates and grew from prior year, on the back of pricing actions undertaken.\r\n\r\nVic Grizzle, president and CEO of Armstrong, said, “We expect the challenging market conditions we experienced in the fourth quarter to continue in 2023 and have incorporated into our outlook further deceleration in market demand in the second half of the year.”\n\nEarnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nArmstrong World reported adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11 by 2.7% and declined 0.9% from $1.09 per share year over year.\n\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Quote\n\nNet sales of $304.5 million topped the consensus mark of $300.6 million by 1.3% and grew 7.8% year over year. The upside was driven by favorable Average Unit Value (\"AUV\"), partially offset by lower volumes. Improvements in Mineral Fiber AUV, driven by strong like-for-like pricing and a favorable sales mix, were partially offset by lower Mineral Fiber volume. Increased Architectural Specialties sales also contributed to the growth.\n\nOperational Update\n\nDuring the quarter, the company’s adjusted operating income of $71 million rose 9.2% from the prior-year quarter’s level of $65 million. Adjusted EBITDA also rose 4.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $92 million.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nMineral Fiber: The segment’s sales increased 4.2% on a year-over-year basis to $207.2 million. Volume declined due to weakening market demand in the fourth quarter and a strong prior-year period. Operating income rose 1.8% from the prior-year quarter to $61.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA also increased by 2.1% from the prior-year quarter to $78 million.\r\n\r\nArchitectural Specialties: Net sales in the segment grew 17.5% year over year to $88.5 million, owing to broad-based growth across the product categories. The segment reported an operating income of $10.7 million versus an operating loss of $3.3 million reported a year ago. A $7 million margin benefit from increased sales and a $3 million reduction in intangible asset amortization aided the bottom line. There was also a $9 million decrease in acquisition-related charges, primarily due to a change in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $13 million, up 22.3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\n2022 Highlights\n\nNet sales totaled $1.23 billion, up 11.4% from $1.1 billion in 2021, on favorable AUV and higher volumes. Net sales in the Mineral Fiber increased 8.4% and Architectural Specialties rose 20% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.74, up 8.7% from $4.36 reported in the prior year.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating income grew 5.3% to $220 million from 2021 level. Adjusted EBITDA also rose 3.7% to $385 million from the prior year.\n\nFinancials\n\nAs of Dec 31, 2022, Armstrong World had cash and cash equivalents of $106 million compared with $98.1 million at 2021-end. Net cash provided by operations was $182.4 million in 2022 compared with $187.2 million in 2021.\r\n\r\nAdjusted free cash flow came in at $91 million in fourth-quarter and $221 million, down from $45 million and $190 million reported in the year-ago period. In 2022, AWI repurchased 1.9 million shares of outstanding common stock for $165 million, excluding commissions. As of Dec 31, 2022, there was $349 million remaining under the current authorized share repurchase program (expires on Dec 31, 2023).\n\n2023 Guidance\n\nFor 2023, the company expects weaker economic conditions, partially offset by benefits from the growth initiatives undertaken, ongoing productivity improvements, disciplined cost control and approximately $6 million of annualized cost savings.\r\n\r\nAWI anticipates net sales within $1,260-$1,310 million, indicating a 2-6% increase from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA is projected within $395-$420 million, suggesting a rise of 3-9% year over year. AWI expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.80-$5.05, reflecting growth of 1-7% from 2022. Adjusted free cash flow is anticipated between $230 and $250 million (implying a 4-13% increase from the prior year).\n\nZacks Rank & Peer Releases\n\nArmstrong World currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nOwens Corning OC reported impressive results for fourth-quarter 2022. Quarterly earnings and net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDespite lower volumes, high costs and unfavorable currency, strong pricing helped the company generate higher earnings.\r\n\r\nMasco Corporation MAS reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2022. The bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined on a year-over-year basis due to supply-chain challenges and inflation headwinds.\r\n\r\nNet sales surpassed the consensus mark but declined from the prior-year quarter’s level, thanks to demand softness across the product categories in North America, partially offset by selling price increases.\r\n\r\nUnited Rentals, Inc. URI reported fourth-quarter 2022 results. Its earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but increased on a year-over-year basis on the back of sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.\r\n\r\nURI provided solid full-year 2023 guidance for total revenues and adjusted EBITDA, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility. Also, it unveiled a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with an annualized yield of approximately 1.5%. The company also plans to restart its share repurchase program, with the intention of buying back $1 billion of common stock in 2023.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "Elme Communities (NYSE:ELME) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 17, 2023\n\nOperator: Welcome to the Elme Communities Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Amy Hopkins, Vice President, Investor Relations. Amy, please go ahead.\n\nAmy Hopkins: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Paul McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Riffee, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer; Steven Freishtat, Vice President of Finance; Grant Montgomery, Vice President and Head of Research; and Drew Hammond, Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer, and Treasurer. Today's event is being webcast through the Investors section of our website at elmecommunities.com, and a replay will be available this afternoon. We will have a slide presentation in conjunction with our prepared remarks and those slides will be available on our webcast replay. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone that this conference call contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially and we undertake no duty to update them as actual events unfold.\n\nWe refer to certain of these risks in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are available in our most recent earnings press release and financial supplement, which was distributed yesterday and can be found on the Investors page of our website. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul McDermott: Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We ended the year with a strong fourth quarter performance and 2023 is off to a good start with solid operating fundamentals and favorable demand indicators. We are reiterating our 2023 guidance, which reflects double-digit same-store NOI and core FFO growth. Our investment grade balance sheet is in great shape with low leverage and ample liquidity and we have no debt maturities until 2025. We feel very good about our AFFO growth outlook and we are increasing our quarterly dividend by approximately 6%. The economic outlook continues to evolve and we will likely face a slowing economy this year. While we are not immune, our mid-market strategy is designed to outperform across cycles and to provide relative insulation during downturns when residents are more likely to trade down to a lower rent level instead of trading up.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past 5 and 10-year periods, our target vintages have outperformed newer vintages in our respective markets. Towards the end of last year, we began to see headlines surrounding job cuts for high-wage technology positions due to the intentional cooling of the economy by the Fed. However, in the Washington Metro, the tech-heavy, informational and professional, scientific and technical sectors continue to grow, up 2.7% and 2% respectively year-over-year. As recently highlighted in the Wall Street Journal, a study of software engineering job postings at year end found that Washington region has more job openings in this field than the San Francisco Bay Area. The strength in these jobs is particularly evident in Northern Virginia, where most of our portfolio is located and where the information sector, which includes software engineering jobs, grew at a brisk rate of 5.6% in 2022.\n\nThe Washington Metro is known to have the most stable employment of all gateway markets. This stability supported very strong credit performance throughout the pandemic as we sustained 99% collection rates and we expect to continue to experience solid collection trends. Furthermore, multifamily rent growth for the Washington Metro is expected to outperform the U.S. average this year and nearly all the major gateway markets. In Atlanta, the regional economy is projected to fare well in the face of increased macroeconomic headwinds in 2023, maintaining job growth of over 1% according to Oxford Economics. Over the long-term, we continue to believe that Atlanta's industrial mix will drive outsized job creation, wage growth and net migration, supporting sustained demand for apartments that are affordable to the largest segments of the renter market.\n\nIn terms of the potential impact from new supply in a slowing economy, our price points are well below the rent levels for new deliveries. In the Washington Metro, our monthly rents are over $600 below nearby Class A communities. In Atlanta, our monthly rents are over $500 below nearby Class A communities. Furthermore, our communities are not located in areas that are receiving high supply. Almost 88% of the new supply in the Atlanta Metro is delivering outside of Elme submarkets in 2023 and 2024. And in Washington, development is highly concentrated in the region's core versus our suburban focus with 84% of units under construction inside the Capital Beltway. Again, in both markets, the new supply is priced above our price points for different renter cohorts.\n\nIn terms of the impact of a slowing economy on the cost of homeownership, the national cost of owning a home compared to renting a single-family starter home is the highest it's been in over 20 years. The cost of owning a home in our markets has grown more than renting an apartment over the past few years and now stands at nearly $600 per month or 28% above our rents in Atlanta and over $1,200 per month or 43% above our rents in the Washington Metro. Even after factoring the potential for home price declines, homeownership will remain unaffordable for median income renters in our markets. To summarize, our portfolio offers downside protection and a slowing economy for the following reasons. First, our resident base is less exposed to job losses.\n\nSecond, our price points serve as a buffer during periods of supply pressure. Third, we do not have exposure to high-supply submarkets. And lastly, housing remains undersupplied in our markets, driving up the cost of homeownership, which is particularly impactful for median income households. Our rent levels are affordable for the largest and most underserved renter cohorts and our communities to benefit from sustained demand for affordable rental options over the near and longer term. We are now in the final phase of our infrastructure transformation, which includes transitioning community level operations to Elme management. The process has been seamless thus far and we will have nearly 40% of our homes under management by next week, over 50% by the end of the quarter and all communities under management by the end of the summer.\n\nThe full spectrum of operational benefits is extensive and we continue to identify opportunities to deliver operational upside once our community onboarding process is complete. We built an operating platform that is highly scalable and we continue to see the opportunity to deliver positive operating leverage by growing our portfolio and expanding it into the Sunbelt markets. We are confident in our investment strategy and our ability to create value through thoughtful capital allocation. The markets that we are targeting have industries with the best long-term growth prospects and a growing need for affordable rental options for median incomes. While deal volumes remain muted, we are actively underwriting opportunities. We will be ready to act when the time is right and will only pursue opportunities that we expect will create value for our shareholders and align with our strategy and mission.\n\nThis year, we plan to extend the rollout of Smart Home technology to all our communities. We designed our Smart Home initiative to improve our residents' day-to-day experience at investment levels that makes sense for mid-market price points. Our initial program includes smart locks, smart thermostats, smart lights and water leak sensors. Overall, these technologies will provide ease of living for our residents, reduce our operating expenses, advance our environmental goals and enable a better digital experience in the form of self-guided tours for potential residents. I am pleased to share that we made substantial progress on our ESG initiatives during 2022. Delivering industry-leading ESG performance for value-oriented community is core to our goal of elevating the standard for value living. Building, Real Estate, Investment\n\nPhoto by Digital Marketing Agency NTWRK on Unsplash\n\nTo quickly summarize our achievements, we achieved our highest GRESB score to-date, achieved our greenhouse gas and water goals, aligned our reporting with GRI standards, joined the better climate initiatives, increased our multifamily sustainability certifications and expanded the number of EV chargers at our communities. As we transition our communities to Elme management, we are advancing financial inclusion by providing our residents the ability to boost their credit scores by submitting on-time rent payments to all three credit bureaus at no cost. ESG is core to our mission of delivering a superior living experience for mid-market rents and we are pleased with the progress we made in 2022 and look forward to keeping you updated on our ESG goals.\n\nBefore I turn it over to Steve Riffee to provide an update on our operating trends and to cover full year and fourth quarter performance, I'd like to say a few words of gratitude. This is Steve's last earnings call with us ahead of his retirement on February 28. I cannot thank Steve enough for the dedication that he has shown this company over the past 8 years. His leadership and vision were instrumental to our transformation and he is leaving us with a team that is well-prepared to drive our company forward. He will be greatly missed by everyone who worked with him and we wish him the best in his retirement.\n\nSteve Riffee: Thank you, Paul. I am grateful to you and to our team for all we were able to do together and I am looking forward to the growth ahead for our company going forward. Now starting with our operating trends, the year is off to a strong start and demand indicators continue to look good through the winter months. Year-to-date traffic and application volumes are up on a year-over-year basis, extending the trend that we experienced during the second half of last year. Effective new lease rate growth was 1.1% and the effective renewal lease rate growth was 10.1%, which blends to 5.7% for same-store move-ins that took place during the fourth quarter. Thus far this year, demand trends remained solid and lease rates have increased since December.\n\nEffective blended lease rate growth averaged 4.5% for January move-ins comprised of renewal lease rate growth of 8.8% and new lease rate growth of 1.3%. For February move-in so far, effective blended lease rate growth increased to 5.8% for our same-store communities comprised of renewal lease rate growth of 9.1% and new lease rate growth of 3.7%. Our revenue maximization strategy prioritizes occupancy over lease rate growth during the winter months. And as such, we adjusted pricing to sustain occupancy during our lightest volume months. New lease rates are on an upward trend and we are currently signing new leases with effective rate increases of over 4% on average. Looking forward, we expect new lease rates to continue to increase to the mid single-digits in the spring and summer leasing seasons followed by a decline to the low single-digits toward next winter.\n\nRenewal lease rates remain very strong and we are currently sending out renewal offers for April lease expirations with effective rate increases of over 7% on average. And so far, we are experiencing high renewal acceptance rates. We expect renewal rates to trend down from the current high single-digit level, eventually converging to a more normalized level in the low single-digits by the end of the year. All in all, we feel good about the lease rate growth we captured during the fourth quarter and the trends that we are seeing now heading into the spring leasing season. Lease rates tend to be weaker during the winter. And while new lease rates moderated through January, renewal rates remained very strong all through the winter. The combined new and renewals that we are quoting for March and April are providing upward trending rent levels just as we expected, heading into the spring leasing season.\n\nThese are positive winter months, adding to historically high embedded growth as we head into the spring months. Occupancy averaged 95% during the quarter for our same-store portfolio and has increased 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. As of the second week of February, same-store occupancy was 95.6%, positioning us to continue to drive rent growth and capture more of our loss to lease. Retention was 62% during the quarter, which is a slight sequential increase as we continue to experience high renewal demand, supporting very strong renewal rate growth of approximately 9% year-to-date. Average effective monthly rent per home grew 9.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 7.6% for the full year, reflecting the impact of the very strong lease rate growth we captured during 2022.\n\nFor our portfolio, average monthly rent grew significantly more in the second half of 2022 to provide historically high embedded growth at the end of the year. Our current rent levels in February, plus the March move-ins we signed represent rental growth of approximately 5%, which is nearly 70% of the rental rate growth that we expect for the full year. Our current loss to lease, which represents the difference between current asking rents and our in-place rents is approximately 4.4%, and we expect our loss to lease to increase into the spring, given the solid demand trends that we're seeing today. We are where we expected to be heading into the spring and summer leasing season and a line of sight on the busiest leasing months will significantly increase over the next 2 to 3 months.\n\nBy June, we expect to have locked in 90% of our total rental rate growth for the year. We feel good about the visibility that we have today and where rent growth is tracking compared to our expectations. Moving on to renovations. We completed more than 300 full renovations during 2022 and an ROI of over 13%, excluding the rent growth that we achieved on comparable unrenovated units. We expect to be closer to our historical renovation run rate of approximately 600 units per year in 2023 and for renovation-led value creation to drive higher rent and NOI growth over the next few years. Executing value-add renovation at low-teen cash on cash returns on average remains a key part of our growth strategy. Now turning to our full year and fourth quarter financial results.\n\nCore FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.24 per diluted share, representing year-over-year growth of over 40%, driven by strong growth in rental income and the full deployment of our commercial portfolio sale proceeds. Core FFO for 2022 was $0.88 per share, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Multifamily same-store revenue grew by 8.9% for the quarter and 7.3% for the full year due to growth in rental rates, lower concessions, higher occupancy, and an 11% year-over-year decrease in bad debt for the full year. Operating expenses grew 4% for the fourth quarter and 4.6% for the full year, driven by non-controllable expenses, such as real estate taxes and utilities. Multifamily same-store NOI grew 11.6% for the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the full year.\n\nThis represents the end of a strong year, even while executing our transformation, and now we have excellent momentum turning into 2023. Now it is my privilege to turn it over to Steve Freishtat, who I have great confidence in. Steve will cover financing updates and our 2023 outlook. As we announced in November, Steve is succeeding me as Chief Financial Officer following my retirement at the end of this month. Steve brings extensive knowledge of capital markets, strategic transactions, capital allocation, public company operations, and financial planning. He's been instrumental in the execution of our multifamily transformation, and I know he is going to be an excellent CFO. He also has an excellent team that has been through all of this with us and are ready for new opportunities to create value.\n\nSteven Freishtat: Thanks, Steve. You're leaving me with a great team, and we are very excited for the opportunity to continue to build on everything you helped to create over the last 8 years. Now I'll start with our balance sheet. With an annualized fourth-quarter net debt to EBITDA of 4.8x, over $650 million of availability on our line of credit, no secured debt, and no maturities until 2025, our balance sheet is in excellent shape. In keeping with our proactive approach to managing our debt maturity ladder, on January 10, we executed a new 2-year $125 million term loan with two 1-year extension options. We used the proceeds to pay down our previous $100 million term loan with no prepayment penalty and a portion of the balance on our line of credit.\n\nOur new loan has a variable interest rate of adjusted SOFR plus 95 basis points. At a time when many banks are tightening their lending requirements, we have taken steps to ensure our financial flexibility and increase our liquidity. We feel good about our ability to successfully navigate market volatility while executing on our strategy. Now turning to our outlook for 2023. We are reiterating our 2023 core FFO guidance range of $0.96 to $1.04 per fully diluted share, which implies double-digit year-over-year growth. Same-store multifamily NOI growth is expected to range from 9% to 11%, which reflects year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Further building on the double-digit NOI growth achieved in the second half of 2022. Non-same-store multifamily NOI is expected to range from $12.75 million to $13.75 million in 2023.\n\nWhile this guidance range does not reflect the impact of potential acquisitions, we had more than $650 million of availability on our line of credit as of year-end, and we are running below our targeted leverage levels. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in our target markets and will further pursue acquisitions when they create additional value for shareholders. Other same-store NOI, which consists solely of Watergate 600 is expected to range from $13 million to $13.75 million. We are slightly reducing our guidance for G&A net of core adjustments through a range of $25.75 million to $27 million. We expect G&A to decline in 2024 as we realize the full-year benefits of internalizing multifamily operations and then to remain stable as we scale our portfolio when the time is right to do so.\n\nOur G&A guidance excludes the impact of transformation investments for our platform and our full integration, which we now expect to be between $3 million and $4 million. Interest expense is now expected to range between $29 million and $30 million, which incorporates a higher anticipated future Fed funds rate as the interest rate outlook has shifted since we announced our 2023 guidance last year as well as the impact of our new term loan. The new term loan is subject to our existing swap agreement, which fixes the interest rate on $100 million at 2.16% through July 21 of this year. We remain very confident in our NOI growth outlook and are currently within our core FFO guidance range. However, recent Fed actions have put pressure on our midpoint.\n\nIf expectations were to shift further, we will update our interest expense guidance again and possibly our core FFO guidance range. We finished 2022 with a 75% AFFO payout ratio. As Paul mentioned, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by approximately 6% to $0.18 per share, reflecting confidence in our growth in 2023 and beyond and the strength of our AFFO growth profile. We expect our core AFFO payout ratio for this year to be at or below our mid-70s target. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Paul.\n\nPaul McDermott: Thank you, Steve. To conclude, we are where we expected to be at this point in the year. We feel good about our ability to deliver double-digit core FFO growth, which will be driven primarily by rent growth as nearly 70% of that rent growth is already locked in. We are on track to complete the transition of our portfolio to L management by this summer and to begin to see the benefits of that transition and our Smart Home initiatives in 2024. Our strategy offers growth as well as relative insulation during downturns, and we expect to benefit from sustained demand for quality, affordable rental options over the near and longer term. And now operator, I'd like to open it up for questions.\n\nSee also 20 Largest FMCG Companies in the World and 12 Countries that Export the Most Textiles.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

      "content": "Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 17, 2023\n\nOperator: Thank you for standing by, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Star Bulk Carriers Conference Call on the Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results. We have with us Mr. Petros Pappas, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Hamish Norton, President; Mr. Simos Spyrou; and Mr. Christos Begleris, Co-Chief Financial Officers; Mr. Nicos Rescos, Chief Operating Officer; and Mrs. Charis Plakantonaki, Chief Strategy Officer of the Company. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by question-and-answer session. I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today. I will now pass the floor to one of your speakers today, Mr. Spyrou, please go ahead, sir.\n\nSimos Spyrou: Thank you, operator. I'm Simos Spyrou, Co-Chief Financial Officer of Star Bulk Carriers, and I would like to welcome you to our conference call regarding our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Before we begin, I kindly ask you to take a moment to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide number 2 of our presentation. In today's presentation, we will go through our Q4 results, cost evolution during the quarter, an overview of our balance sheet, an update on banker benefit and vessel operations, the latest on the ESG front and our views on industry fundamentals, before opening up for questions. Let us now turn to Slide number 3 of the presentation for a summary of our fourth quarter 2022 highlights.\n\nNet income for the quarter amounted to $86 million and adjusted net income of $93 million or $0.84 per share, adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $135 million for the quarter. For the fourth quarter, as per our existing dividend policy, we declared a dividend per share of $0.60 payable on or about March 14, 2023. The graph on the bottom of the page highlights the cumulative performance over the last 12 months, which illustrates the strength of the platform in a robust drybulk market. Our last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA is $809 million and adjusted net income is $609 million. Over the same period, we have returned a cumulative dividend of $5.1 per share or $526 million to our shareholders. Since 2021, we have declared a total dividend of $9.35 per share or $961 million.\n\nOn the top right of the page, you will see our daily figures per vessel for the quarter. Our time charter equivalent rate was $19,590 per vessel per day. Our combined daily OpEx and net cash cost G&A expenses per vessel per day amounted to $5,182. Therefore, our TCE less OpEx and G&A is approximately $14,400 per day. Slide 4 graphically illustrates the cash flow bridge for Q4. We started the quarter with $393 million in cash, and generated positive cash flow for operating activities of $116 million. After including debt proceeds and repayments, CapEx payments for energy saving devices and ballast water treatment system installments and the third quarter dividend payment, we arrived at a cash balance of $286 million at the end of the quarter.\n\nFor the calculation of our dividend distribution, we have backed the debt prepayment of $44 million that we drew from January 2023 to end at an adjusted balance of $331 million. Please turn to Slide 5 where we highlight the strength of our balance sheet. Our pro forma total liquidity to-date stands at $356 million. Meanwhile, our total debt stands at $1.32 billion. Since 2022, we have completed refinancings totaling $430 million that reduced our interest costs by approximately $5.2 million per year as a result of achieving significantly lower margins. Our next 12 month amortization is $186 million. We have 13 unlevered vessels with market value of $176 million and no debt maturities until 2024. In an increasing interest rate environment, we have interest rate swaps with an outstanding notional of approximately $722 million fixed at an average rate or 46 basis points for an average remaining maturity of 1.1 years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the mark-to-market value of these swaps was $33 million. I will now pass the floor to our COO, Nicos Rescos, for an update on our operational performance.\n\nNicos Rescos: Thank you, Spyrou. In Slide 6, we will illustrate how Star Bulk continues to benefit from a widening of the fuel spread between HSFO and VLSFO. 120 scrubber fitted vessels surpassed 131,000 operating days with the average system availability of 99.5%. At the current Hi5 spread at healthy levels, our scrubbers meaningfully contributed to our profitability. The average power fuel spread currently hovers at around $230 per ton based Singapore export prices, when we cater approximately 60% of our annual fuel demand. Indicatively, the average lifetime spread achieved in Q4 was $253 per ton and $274 dollars per ton for the full year of 2022. For restructuring purposes, on the top left of the slide, we present a sensitivity table that shows the impact that market benefit can have on our bottom-line based on consumption of approximately 700,000 tons of HSFO per annum for our scrubber-fitted vessels. Ship, Transport, Ocean\n\nPhoto by Jens Rademacher on Unsplash\n\nPlease turn to Slide 7, where we provide the operational update. OpEx excluding non-recurring expenses was $4,205 for Q4 2022. Net cash G&A expenses were $977 per vessel per day for the same period. During calendar 2022, Star Bulk assumes management of an additional 19 vessels for third-party managers, streamlining ship management operations and costs spread. In addition, we continue to rate at the top of our listed peers in terms of Rightship safety score. Turning to Slide 8, we provide our fleet snapshot and guidance around our future drivers and vessel upgrade expenses and the relevant total off-hire days. We have completed our first quarter installation program across the fleet and in line with EEXI and CII regulations. We will continue investing in upgrading our fleet further with energy saving devices and telemetry, aimed in improving our fuel consumption and reducing our environmental footprint, further enhancing the commercial attractiveness of the cargo fleet.\n\nOur expected project expense for calendar 2023 is estimated at $27.8 million with a dry docking of 31 vessels with $141.1 million towards our vessels upgrade CapEx. In total, we expect approximately 870 days off-hire for the same period. The above numbers are based on current estimates around dry dock and retrofit planning, vessel employment and yard capacity. I will now pass the floor to our Chief Strategy Officer, Charis Plakantonaki, for an update on our ESG efforts.\n\nCharis Plakantonaki: Thank you, Nico. Please turn to Slide 9, where we provide an update on the ESG margins. For the second year in a row, Star Bulk has participated in the Carbon Disposal Project exceeding its score of B and improving its performance versus last year for a score of B minus. B rating continues to gain the Company's management level, indicating a maturity of taking coordinated action and climate issues. It also plays Star Bulk above growth the industry average of C, and the global average of C which indicates Awareness Level. During 2023 Star Bulk will aim to continue improving its environmental stewardship, by measuring and reporting for the first time also its Scope 3 emissions, namely the emissions which we indirectly affects in our value chain.\n\nOn the regulatory front, Star Bulk has taken all necessary technical and operational measures to ensure compliance with the EEXI and CII targets as set by the international maritime organization, which came into force in January 2023. We continue enhancing our well-being program, on board its vessels and onshore and also making contributions towards vulnerable groups, environmental protection, education and sports. With regards to the Company's governance, Star Bulk is deploying new systems to optimize its commercial and operational performance, and is also further strengthening its cyber security systems, processes and controls. I will now pass the floor to our CEO, Petros Pappas for a market updates and closing remarks.\n\nPetros Pappas: Thank you, Charis. Please turn to Slide 10 for a brief update of supply. During 2022, a total of 31.2 million dwt was delivered and 4.5 million dwt was sent to demolition for a net fleet growth of 26.7 million dwt or 2.8% year-over-year. The supply outlook continues to be the best we have seen in the recent history of dry bulk shipping. Uncertainty on future proportion, high ship building costs and limited ship yard capacity until 2025 have helped keep new orders under control. The order book stands at rate below levels of 7.3% of the fleet with just 25.9 million dwt reported as firm orders during 2022. Furthermore, scrap prices have stabilized at elevated levels and should make the demolition of overage and fuel-efficient tonnage an attractive option during seasonal downturns on the back of the EEXI and CII regulation.\n\nThe average steaming speed of the dry bulk fleet decreased by 3.2% to 11.3 knots during the last year due to record high bunker costs and a weaker freight market. We expect oil prices and banker costs to remain inflated in the medium term, amid the sanctions on Russian oil and strong demand of energy related commodities. The situation along with a new environmental regulation will continue to incentivize slow steaming and support higher scrubber savings. Global port congestion experienced a correction during the second half of 2022. You do a gradual easing of restrictions and the strong decrease of Chinese imports during the first half. Nevertheless, global congestion remains above pre-COVID levels, especially for smaller vessel types due to changes in trading patterns related to the war and seasonal bottlenecks.\n\nAs a result of the bulk trends, growth is unlikely to exceed 2% per annum over the next three years. Let's now turn to Slide 11 for a brief update of demand. According to Clarksons, total dry bulk trade during 2022 is estimated to have contracted by 1.9% in ton miles. Trade was affected by the war in Ukraine, weaker Chinese imports, and a slowdown of global economic activity due to surging commodity prices, inflation interest rate hikes, and a strong U.S. dollar. During 2023, dry bulk demand is projected to increase by 2% internal miles with the IMF forecast for global GDP growth presently standing at 2.9%. We believe that the relaxation of the strict zero COVID policy and reopening of the Chinese economy will have a strong positive effect for the dry bulk market with larger sizes benefiting the most during the second half of the year.\n\nFurthermore, the shift of coal, grain, and minor bulk trade patterns to long -- longer haul route due to inefficiencies related to the war in Ukraine will continue to inflate ton miles. Iron or trade contracted by 3.4% during 2022, and is projected to expand by 0.4% during 2023. China crude steel production decreased by 2% during 2022 as a strict COVID policy limited economic activity and offered no support to the property market downturn that began in 2021. Crude steel production from the rest of the world decreased by 6.5% affected by surge in energy costs and weaker steel margins following the war in Ukraine, nevertheless, China's steel productions showed signs of stabilization during the second half, while lower domestic iron ore output and stockpiles provided positive indicator for imports point forward.\n\nCoal trade expanded by 1.8% during 2022 and is projected to expand by 4.2% during 2023. Global focus on energy security and high gas prices have upgraded the coal trade outlook for the next few years while the suffering of European and Russian coal trade is benefiting ton miles. Coal prices increased to record high levels in 2022 due to the disruptions and inefficiencies affecting export capacity. During the last month, a resumption of Chinese coal -- Australian origin is taking place marking the end of the unofficial ban that started during the fourth quarter of 2020. Grain trade contracted by 3.1% during 2022 and is projected to rebound by 5.3% during 2023. At the start of 2022, grain trade market experience the supply shock as the war abrupt how did the Ukrainian export for six months, which account for 10% of total grain trade.\n\nFrom August onwards, Ukrainian export partially resumed through the Ukraine initiative at around 40% of free world levels. The outlook for 2023 is positive as results of trade route is already taking place, another exporting nations filling the gap of the lost Ukrainian supply. Furthermore, a record high Brazilian soybean crop is currently harvested while the recovery of the Chinese economy should substantial increase the demand of soybean crops. Minor bulk trade contracted by 2.1% during 2022 and is projected to expand by 1.3% during 2023. Minor bulk trade has the highest correlation to global GDP growth and the economic slowdown has affected trade volumes. Moreover, the container ship market correction is moderating support of smaller geared dry bulk vessels.\n\nOn the other hand, the war in the Ukraine disrupted European Union of fertilizing and steel production creating Atlantic shortages that should benefit bulk trade trades. Furthermore, West Africa bauxite exports continue to expand with the high base and generate strong ton miles for Capesize vessels. Finally, despite the current seasonal spot market weakness, the long term prospects of the dry bulk market remain encouraging given the 25-year low order book, the environmental regulations and the positive effect on dry bulk demand from the opening of the Chinese economy. Star Bulk is well-positioned due to its scrubber fitted in diverse fleet, take advantage of recovery in freight rates. Without taking any more time, I will now pass the floor over to the operator to answer any questions you may have.\n\nSee also 12 Countries that Export the Most Textiles and 25 Best Countries for Retirement.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

      "content": "Block, Inc. SQ is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 23.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.53 billion, suggesting a growth of 11.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 30 cents per share, suggesting a growth of 11.1% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 43.7% on average.\n\nBlock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Block, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nBlock, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Block, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors at Play\n\nBlock’s portfolio strength is anticipated to get reflected in fourth-quarter results.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strengthening presence in the “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) market on the back of its expanding offerings is expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, Block’s Afterpay introduced a monthly payment solution to deliver an enhanced BNPL experience to merchants and their customers.\r\n\r\nFurther, Afterpay teamed up with various fashion and footwear retailers in Canada such as Blondo, Dolce Vita, Fragrance Canada, HAVEN, Pilgrim, Vessi and VSP in the fourth quarter in a bid to gain momentum in the holiday shopping season.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Afterpay witnessed a strong momentum during the holiday shopping season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. During this period, BNPL transactions through Afterpay grew by 120% as compared with the pre-holiday figure.\r\n\r\nApart from these, the company’s strong omni-channel offerings, which aid sellers in managing orders from POS and eliminating manual aggregation of online and in-person orders, are expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nStrength in online channels, including Square Online, Invoices, Virtual Terminal and eCommerce API, is likely to have aided growth in card-not-present payment volumes. Also, Block’s growing card-present volume is expected to have been a positive.\r\n\r\nThe increasing adoption of Cash App is likely to have aided growth in Block’s gross payment volume in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nHowever, uncertainties related to the pandemic are anticipated to have been concerning.\r\n\r\nA slowdown in bitcoin trading activities is likely to have acted as a major headwind. Also, increasing advertising and personnel costs are anticipated to have weighed on the profitability of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Block this time around.

      "title": "Select Medical (SEM) to Post Q4 Earnings: What to Expect",
      "content": "Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM is set to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 23, after the closing bell.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 21 cents, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 52.3% due to higher costs and expenses, along with weak performance in the Critical Illness Recovery Hospital unit. However, the negatives were partially offset by higher patient days and improved performance in the Rehabilitation Hospital unit.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.\n\nThe Trend in Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of 33 cents has witnessed no movement in the past week. The estimate indicates a 10.8% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of 37 cents per share. Our estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line is also pegged at 33 cents per share.\n\nBoth the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues are pegged at $1.6 billion, suggesting a rise of 3.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nSelect Medical’s earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, the average negative surprise being 3.2%. This is depicted in the graph below.\n\nSelect Medical Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Select Medical Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSelect Medical Holdings Corporation price-eps-surprise | Select Medical Holdings Corporation Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nSelect Medical’s fourth-quarter results are expected to witness improved figures in Rehabilitation Hospital aided by the growing number of hospitals, the average length of stay, patient days and occupancy rate. We expect revenues from the segment to have witnessed almost 10% growth from a year ago.\n\nOur estimate for the Outpatient Rehabilitation unit’s number of visits indicates 2.5% year-over-year growth. Its patient services revenues are expected to have increased 4.8% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, we expect growing visits in the Concentra segment to have aided its revenue growth. The factors stated above are likely to have positioned Select Medical for year-over-year growth in revenues. However, its rising operating costs are expected to have been spoilsports.\n\nLower occupancy rates and admissions are expected to have affected the Critical Illness Recovery Hospital unit in the fourth quarter. Our estimate for operating income from the segment indicates a decline of more than 30%. This is expected to have curtailed the company’s margins, making an earnings beat uncertain.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Select Medical this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.\n\nEarnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at 33 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: Select Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Select Medical, here are some companies in the broader medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:\n\nVir Biotechnology, Inc. VIR has an Earnings ESP of +338.10% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vir Biotechnology’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 30 days against none in the opposite direction. VIR beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once.\n\nSI-BONE, Inc. SIBN has an Earnings ESP of +5.51% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SI-BONE’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 2.3% improvement from a year ago.

MRUS has an Earnings ESP of +28.91% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Merus’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter has remained stable over the past week.

      "title": "4 Consumer Stocks With High Probability to Beat on Earnings",
      "content": "Though the earnings season has reached its pinnacle, the main chunk of releases from the Retail-Wholesale sector is yet to come. This reporting cycle, the sector is likely to have witnessed a modest acceleration in sales with a decline in the bottom line.\r\n\r\nPer the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, the sector is anticipated to have witnessed top-line growth of 5.1% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022. This follows an 8.3% increase in the preceding season. Meanwhile, the bottom line is expected to have declined 32% this earnings season. The sector registered an earnings decline of 5.3% in the previous reporting cycle.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nProduct cost inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the sector have been encountering lately. This has been putting pressure on margins, and in turn the bottom line. Meanwhile, soaring prices have squeezed consumers’ disposable income compelling them to rein in spending. As a result, quite a few retailers juggled with excess inventory.\r\n\r\nTo beat the blues, retailers have been reengaging with customers, reviewing pricing, refreshing assortments and mitigating costs wherever possible. Companies have been also directing resources toward advancing omni-channel capabilities and providing high-end customer service.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, the fourth-quarter reporting cycle includes the U.S. holiday season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers. Disappointingly, holiday numbers came below expectations as consumers navigated inflationary pressure and high borrowing cost environment. That being said, declining unemployment and steady wage gains still kept the demand alive.\r\n\r\nData compiled by the National Retail Federation (NRF) showed that holiday retail sales increased 5.3% year over year to $936.3 billion during 2022’s November-December period. However, the numbers were below NRF’s projection of 6% to 8% increase over the 2021 period to between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaking the Perfect Choice\n\nWith the earnings season in full swing, it is worthwhile to invest in companies with earnings beat potential.

      "content": "Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 23, 2023, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 28.7%.\n\nThe Trend in Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 97 cents per share, indicating a deterioration of 1% from a loss of 96 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at approximately $3,399 million, suggesting an increase of 25.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nLive Nation Entertainment, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLive Nation Entertainment, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. Quote\n\nLet's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nLive Nation’s fourth quarter performance is likely to have benefitted from increased demand for global live events, solid onsite spending and Ticketmaster services. This and strength in the sponsorship business are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous quarter, the company reported double-digit attendance growth across all venue types, including clubs, theaters, amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and festivals. During the quarter, fan attendance at the Venue Nation division was up 14% from 2019 levels. Also, it stated benefits from theater live events platforms (in terms of attracting new brands and expanding current partnerships) and strategic pricing. Given the strength in the supply and demand dynamic (with artists and fans) coupled with an emphasis on elevating hospitality operations, adding more venues (for boosting concert business) and platform integrations (with online partnerships), the momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues from Ticketing, Concerts and Sponsorships and Advertisements are pegged at $521 million, $2,689 million and $197 million, indicating a rise of 6.8%, 31.6% and 15.9%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter’s figure.\r\n\r\nHowever, supply chain disruptions and delays in construction projects are likely to have affected the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. Increased costs related to artist fees, event production, show-related marketing and advertising expenses are likely to have impacted margins in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat Live Nation this time around. A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. But that's not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Live Nation has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company has a Zacks Rank #3.

OSW’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 84.2%.\r\n\r\nMonarch Casino & Resort, Inc. MCRI has an Earnings ESP of +4.12% and a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nShares of Monarch Casino have increased 7.8% in the past year. MCRI’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark thrice in the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 3.7%.\r\n\r\nPlanet Fitness, Inc. PLNT has an Earnings ESP of +2.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nShares of Planet Fitness have declined 15% in the past year.

      "content": "CommScope Holding Company, Inc. COMM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 4.17%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 24.11%, on average. The company's strategy of assisting its channel partners by creating various tools and the strong demand for its Home and Distributed Access Architecture (DAA) Module solutions are likely to have boosted the top line.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nIn the December quarter, the company introduced the HomeSight system that external parties can use for different personalized homecare activities related to healthcare, residential care, medical trials, remote patient monitoring and community connections. During the quarter, CommScope announced that Kraydel’s Konnect, a remote monitoring platform, will deploy the HomeSight system. The system is easy to install and comes with various features such as automated source switching, an easy-to-use remote control, video calling through TV, IOS and Android mobile app for care workers, family and friends, photo sharing, video uploads and text messaging. The top-line performance of the business will probably be aided by  such innovative products.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, CommScope inked an agreement with Mediacom communications to support the transition of its network to a Distributed Access Architecture (DAA) based on Remote MACPHY. After completing a successful trial of CommScope's Remote PHY solution in its advanced 10G Smart Home, Mediacom intends to employ CommScope's RD2322 RxD to ensure optimal use of RF spectrum, lower latency services and a new level of capacity for its subscribers. One of the top cable operators in North America, Mediacom, believes that upgrading its optical nodes in conjunction with the market-leading DAA Module solutions from CommScope would enable a smooth transition to the next phase of network evolution. This is likely to have had a positive impact on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, the company unveiled its Infrastructure Distributor Program, which aims to provide channel partners with capabilities like automated account management, on-demand news and social feeds, a premier learning management system, educational resources, and incentives for customer expansion. It will also emphasize on helping the elite partners grow their businesses through promotions and by providing them with top-tier services and benefits. The company's fourth-quarter earnings are likely going to benefit from this.\r\n\r\nHowever, supply chain headwinds and rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China are expected to have affected the company's top-line performance. In addition, lower spending tendency of cable operators and wireless carriers combined with rising costs are putting pressure on earnings prospects.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of the company stands at $2,326 million, indicating an increase from $2,224 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 47 cents per share. It had reported earnings of 23 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not predict earnings beat for CommScope for the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -12.30%, with the former pegged at 41 cents and latter at 47 cents.

The company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.\r\n\r\nIn the last quarter, American Tower missed adjusted FFO per share estimates by 2.48%. However, over the preceding four quarters, the company topped FFO per share estimates on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average beat being 1.13%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation Price and EPS Surprise American Tower Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation price-eps-surprise | American Tower Corporation Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before the earnings release.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nAmerican Tower’s extensive and geographically diversified communication real estate portfolio is expected to have benefited from increased capital spending by wireless carriers due to incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions. This demand for AMT’s portfolio of communication sites in the fourth quarter of 2022 is likely to have aided its top line.\r\n\r\nAlso, the demand for American Tower’s highly interconnected data center facilities and critical cloud on-ramps is anticipated to have remained robust during the quarter. Further, the company’s solid balance sheet strength is expected to have aided its investments in existing 4G networks as well as its efforts for 5G deployment during the quarter under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.68 billion, indicating a rise of 9.6% from the year-earlier period.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from the Property segment is pegged at $2.59 billion, indicating growth from the $2.44 billion reported in the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nHowever, operating revenues from the Service segment are expected to be on the lower side in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $60.79 million, indicating a decline from the $67.0 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nA hike in interest rates is anticipated to have raised interest expenses and borrowing costs to purchase or develop real estate.\r\n\r\nAmerican Tower’s activities in the fourth quarter were not adequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share has been revised marginally downward to $2.23 over the past month. However, it suggests a year-over-year increase of 2.3%.\r\n\r\nFor the full-year 2022, American Tower anticipated total property revenues in the range of $10,395-$10,485 million, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 14.6% at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $6,580-$6,660 million, indicating a midpoint increase of 10.6% year over year. Consolidated AFFO is expected between $4,595 and $4,675 million, implying a year-over-year midpoint expansion of 6.0%.\r\n\r\nFurther, AFFO for common stockholders is anticipated in the band of $4,430-$4,510 million, suggesting midpoint growth of 4.5% year over year. AFFO per share is expected in the band of $9.57-$9.74, indicating an increase of 2.3% year over year. Capital expenditure is projected between $1.895 and $1.995 billion.\r\n\r\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the FFO per share is pegged at $9.70. The figure indicates a 0.5% increase year over year on 14.2% year-over-year growth in revenues to $10.68 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for AMT this season.
